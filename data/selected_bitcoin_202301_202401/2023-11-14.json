        "content": "Boyaa Interactive, a Hong Kong-based gaming company, revealed plans for a potential investment in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as this endeavor seeks to enhance the Group's asset allocation strategy.\n\nFollowing an earlier voluntary announcement in August 2023, Boyaa's Board views BTC and crypto acquisition as pivotal for its business expansion and asset allocation strategy.

        "title": "Bitcoin Up Triple-Digits This Year: ETFs in Focus - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The cryptocurrency market has experienced a resurgence in November. In the past one month (as of Nov 10, 2023), bitcoin price has surged 37.4%. This notable price increase has renewed interest and excitement in the crypto space after a period of relative stagnation.\n\nMarket analysts and experts are optimistic about the crypto market's outlook for the remaining two months of the year. This renewed bullish sentiment follows a robust recovery during the first seven months of the year, which had helped erase the disappointment of the previous year. Bitcoin is up 124% so far this year.\n\nFactors Behind the Rally\n\nSeveral key factors have contributed to the renewed rally in the cryptocurrency market:\n\nPause in Interest Rate Hikes: The Fed's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rates between 5.25% and 5.5% in both its September and November Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings has had a significant impact on crypto rally. Despite inflation levels exceeding the Fed's 2% target, recent labor market data suggesting a slowing job market has raised the possibility that the Federal Reserve may halt its ongoing monetary tightening campaign. This has instilled confidence in investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, as higher interest rates typically have a dampening effect on growth sectors like technology, consumer discretionary, and cryptocurrency.\n\nPositive Impact on Cryptocurrency: The cryptocurrency market's response to the Federal Reserve's decision has been positive. The pause in interest rate hikes has created a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies to flourish, as it removes a potential hurdle to their growth. The rally is not limited to Bitcoin alone. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Binance Coin (BNB), have all experienced a resurgence in value during the same period. This broad market recovery underscores the strength of the current crypto rally.\n\nStory continues\n\nExpectations of SEC Okaying a Bitcoin ETF\n\nAnother significant driver of investor optimism is the expectation that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is close to approving a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The approval of such an ETF would be a milestone for the cryptocurrency market, as it would provide traditional investors with a regulated and convenient avenue to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies through regular stock markets. This development is expected to increase demand for cryptocurrencies and attract new investments, potentially fueling further market growth.\n\nContinued Growth Expected\n\nGiven the current momentum and positive developments, the cryptocurrency market is poised for continued growth. Bitcoin's impressive performance, with its price more than doubling year-to-date, indicates that the ongoing rally is likely to persist, generating increased interest and enthusiasm among investors.\n\nETFs to Gain\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below-mentioned ETFs should be in focus for stellar gains.\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF BTF \u2013 Up 109.9% Past Year; Up 39.6% Past Month\n\nValkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF available through Nasdaq.

        "title": "Cathie Wood: Odds of spot bitcoin ETF approval have gone up - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ARK Invest is teaming up with 21shares to launch new crypto-focused ETFs. ARK Invest Founder and CEO Cathie Wood says the partnership made sense given how complementary the firms' areas of expertise are. Wood says that bitcoin (BTC-USD) is \"the first global, digital, private rules based monetary system in history\" adding that global monetary policy is \"unhinged, it's not hinged to anything except human decision-making\" and that \"the monetary system is bitcoin.\"\n\nArk is one of the several firm trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. Wood says \"something has changed,\" noting that the Securities and Exchange Commission has responded to their application with questions instead of just rejecting it. Wood believes this means that the odds of approval have gone up. Overall, Wood is still bull on bitcoin, saying her base case for the cryptocurrency is $600,000-$650,000. However, she thinks it could go higher, given the currency's scarcity and the potential for more institutional investment if a spot bitcoin ETF is approved.\n\nClick here to see the full interview with ARK Invest's Cathie Wood.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: One of the assets that perhaps surprisingly was not rising today was bitcoin, even though it has rallied as of late today, falling by some 3.4%. And it's on this day that Cathie Wood announced or ARK Invest announced in cooperation with 21shares. It's going to be launching a new suite of digital asset ETFs. They will be actively managed.\n\nAnd I had the chance to talk to her about digital assets, broadly about these products specifically, and, of course, about her still bullish stance on cryptocurrency.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: This is the first global, digital, private, rules-based monetary system in history. It's a very big idea. When we wrote the paper in collaboration with Art Laffer-- you know Art Laffer supply-side economics, Laffer curve-- he said, I've been waiting for this since they closed the gold window in 1971. So he's been waiting 50 years for this, right? And he's so excited about everything crypto, but especially bitcoin, because he believes, and it is true, monetary policy around the world is unhinged. It's not hinged to anything except human decision making.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd this is going to put discipline, rigor back into--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: These particular products you're talking.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: Well, bitcoin is. The monetary system is bitcoin. And so, yes, the-- why now for these? We've been working with 21shares since I met Ophelia at an ETF confab in 2018. They had really just started their business. And I said, you know, we want to move towards crypto. You are completely crypto. They were focused on the infrastructure, the regulations, really blazing a trail. They had to invent things in order to make this happen.\n\nAnd we knew that was not our core competency. And so we-- but we did start talking. Our core competency is research on disruptive innovation. And they do research. They do deep technical research on the market. Our research is on the disruptive innovation that it represents. And we've just been coming together for five years. It was a natural for us to come together.\n\nThey are or 21shares is the largest crypto ETP provider in the world, $1.5 billion. They have 35 different funds. Most of them in Europe in and around Europe. They were looking for a US entry. And we were looking for infrastructure. And, you know, we're just delighted to be partnering with them given how much groundwork they had to lay for this to happen.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Speaking of groundwork, on another product that you're working on, of course, the spot bitcoin ETF, which you are also partnering with them on. And you've got your filing in. There's a lot of filings in. Every day, seemingly, there is a new rumor about approval of one of these things. What are you hearing from the SEC at this point? Are-- you know, there's a January deadline I know that people have been looking to. How confident are you that you're going to get approval?\n\nCATHIE WOOD: Well, something has changed. So we had put in a number of times a filing. And we were just denied. Never got any questions really, never got any response. This time, this summer, we got questions back from the SEC. Now, normally, when you get questions from the SEC, you're just saying, oh, my goodness. We were thrilled to get questions back, because it means they're engaged now.\n\nNow, we have met a number of the research people at the SEC on the research side. And they are extremely sophisticated. They know what they're talking about. And the level of sophistication of their questions suggested, OK, now they're moving deeply into this. And we answered those questions. We have not heard back. That's a good sign, too. They never tell you that-- tell you that you've satisfied them. But if you don't hear from them, they-- that usually means that you have satisfied the answers to the requests.\n\nSo that was new. And we also know that BlackRock got questions. We put our answers in first. I think they have followed. And I'm not sure about anyone else. That was different. And it says, OK, there's movement. And we are the first in line, just because we kept refiling. Others gave up. And so-- but we just kept re filing. We just kept-- and we became first in line. So David against Goliath, right?\n\nAnd that's January 10th is the final deadline. They've been able to push it. It's a very orchestrated. Push it, push it, but the final, they either approve or deny on January 10th.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: What do you think?\n\nCATHIE WOOD: Well, again, I mentioned something has changed.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: That's good. The odds have gone up. There is only one wrinkle just occurred to us in the last couple of days. They will approve a number at once. It won't be just one. That would be choosing a winner given the way ETFs work.\n\nBut we know Grayscale wants to convert to an ETF. I don't know how practical that is, or if the SEC will let them, or if they need a special dispensation. I just don't know the rules. Grayscale has said it will sue the SEC again if it denies the conversion. If they were to do that before January 10th, I don't know if that would throw everything up in the air again.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: For the others as well.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: For everyone.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right.\n\nCATHIE WOOD: Yeah. I just don't know. I don't know.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So there's still a lot of unknowns out there. You mentioned you guys bought into bitcoin at 250 way back when. So the return from 250 to 35, 36 looks pretty good. But it's not 100,000 that I think you and I have talked about at various points or even loftier numbers. Where are we in that cycle?\n\nCATHIE WOOD: I think-- so if we look at the reasons that bitcoin will scale, so our base case is today 600 to 650-- $650,000, and our bull case, based on the scarcity that is now developing, we're at roughly 19.5 million bitcoin out there, there will only be 21 million ever. And we do believe that.\n\nWe think that institutions, if the SEC blesses a bitcoin ETF, institutions will feel like the coast is clear for them to pursue. And we know a lot of institutions have been researching crypto assets for a while and do agree that it is a new asset class. Bitcoin was the first in a new asset class. We wrote-- we wrote a paper in 2000-- I think it was '16, ringing the bell for a new asset class. And our director of digital assets said to me, do you realize that happened today? We rang the bell for a new asset class. I said, oh, I didn't make that connection.\n\nAnyway, so institutions understand when there is a new asset class, it's-- there's an opportunity to diversify and increase returns per unit of risk. That's very important. They've also learned that bitcoin, in particular, can be a hedge against both inflation and deflation."

        "title": "SkyBridge's Scaramucci Says Bitcoin, Ethereum Prices to Trend Higher - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\n[CC may contain inaccuracies] I want to get your thoughts initially on what do you think the economic and investment environment will be like in the US over the next 12 months? Do you think the Fed's done hiking rates? I do think the Fed is done hiking. And good morning to you guys. I think that the the inflation data was very positive and it's likely to go lower over the next quarter. And so Rick Rieder, a personal friend of mine, actually gave a presentation in Park City at Governor Romney's conference about a month ago and explained the the churning down of inflation. And I think that's very, very good for stock prices, very good for assets. But, of course, what do people want for Christmas in America? They want a low interest rate mortgage. And if you look at housing data in the United States right now, those markets are quite sluggish. I think the Fed is going to respond to that. You'll probably see cuts in interest rates before the end of the first quarter. And so that's very positive for asset prices across the board. Okay. You mentioned last time Bloomberg spoke with you about, you know, you had a great October for your fund. I think it's the best month you've had in the history of SkyBridge. A lot of it was crypto, which I'll get to later. But what what's the other part of that? I mean, is there any parts of that of your portfolio that really kind of benefit from maybe either higher for longer or a less sort of tightening environment? I guess who else, unfortunately, versus the bets that hurt us last year? We we left on for this year. And so unfortunately in investing, sometimes you can get the timing wrong. But we made the case in the fourth quarter of last year in the early part of 2023, that the Fed would start cutting rates more quickly, that inflation would come down more quickly once the supply chain had reconnected. And you saw all of this induction of new technology like A.I., robotic technology, etc., bringing down prices. And so we got the timing wrong. But if you're a long term investor, if you were patient with us, you did quite well. And and last year at this time here at this all conference, as I mentioned during the commercial break, I think Bitcoin was about 16 or 17,000. We have a 10% position in Bitcoin in our portfolio and of course that's gone up to 35, 36,000 in the last year. And I think that went up contrary to institutional sentiment at the time. Over the last year people were quite negative. I was in Davos, Switzerland, being interviewed by some of your colleagues. January of this year, everyone had written off Bitcoin. Of course, it went up about 115% since then. So it's a combination of a couple of different factors, but it's mostly about being bullish about the return of the global economy and global growth. post-COVID. It just took longer than people expected, but we're there now. Yeah, from 6000 to 35. Now, you mentioned 10% weighting. How are you managing your exposure to crypto? What do you suspect the changes will be over the next couple of months? Anthony? Well, I mean, I think one of the things we're very proud of is we're we were the first outside capital into the BlackRock Bitcoin Trust. And so as you guys know, they filed for a formal application with the SCC, the deadline for that application at least for the Ark application, Cathie Wood's is January 10th. It appears likely that these things will get approved if that happens. I think there's an induction of a tremendous amount of demand for Bitcoin and of course you have a happening in Bitcoin, which basically means the supply is going to get cut in half in April. So having lower supply, more demand, we think prices are going to trend higher for Bitcoin, Etherium and a few other currencies. And for those reasons we're going to stay long in the portfolio. And you know what? Well, you know, it's a concentrated bet for us, but we like it. It's a macro overlay. And I guess you guys will remember the beginning part of the year with the Silicon Valley bank crises. Bitcoin was quite resilient and it seems to also do what you'd want an alternative investment to do is go contra into carry indicatori to the overall market. And I think it's safe to say you're still deep into crypto. And of course, obviously your name was mentioned during those SBF trials. Well, I want to get your take on the verdict now that we have one here as well. And overall the future of FDX 2.0. Would you invest in it? Would I invest in it? Well, depends on who's running it. I think number one, I think if you read Michael Lewis's book, there was a business there. He had 12 and a half percent of the cryptocurrency market. So I think the sloppiness and the indiscretion and the eventual fraud obviously ruined the the business and ruin the reputation of that business. But there is a good. Underlying business of you. Tell me who's managing it. I would be open minded to that. But since you're mentioning FDA, I think it's important to point out to people last year at this time at this conference, Sam Bankman-fried had just declared bankruptcy and he was about to be arrested. And so it's a full year later. He's already been convicted for the fraud. His sentencing comes it comes in March. I think it was fair. You know, I spoke at an event here for the Singapore Monetary Authority yesterday and explained that a good regulatory process is clear, transparent rules. But if there are bad actors, they've got to get convicted and have to pay the price for the crimes that they're committing. And I think we're seeing that in the United States. I think that sending a message of deterrence to people, but it's also sending a message of greater safety in these markets for investors. So there's a combination of positive things happening this year. And of course, if you interviewed me last year at this time, there was less than positive things happening. So, Anthony, just everyone was asking about 2.0. Just a quick update, please. If you could give us a timeline on 1.0. They still have a stake in you guys. Do you still plan on buying them, taking that stake back? You have a timetable for that? Yes. So unfortunately, we're waiting for the bag. We've created a data room for the bankruptcy estate to look at and to make a decision on when they'll give us the opportunity to buy back those assets. I still think that's likely a year or two away, and we're in no rush because, of course, there was no controlling stake and there's no voting interest or even economic preference in that stake. So we're running the business just like we've run it before with no interruption. But you're asking about tax. If that's going to go alive, it'll probably be the back half of 2024. My prediction is that they'll eventually sell those assets and that technology to somebody that will restart that exchange. And so we'll have to see what happens. But I think that's very likely. How much time. So I've got to ask you about, you know, we have a U.S. election that's coming up as well. Do you do you have any sort of projection here? Are we going to back this time? Give me of course, you had a short stint in the White House. I'm in the I'm in the ABC camp. You know, anybody but anybody but Trump. And so if it's Trump versus Biden, I will be actively advocating for President Biden. I have supported Governor Christie, and I'm hopeful that he can have a good showing in New Hampshire. If that doesn't happen and the president does get the nomination. President Trump, I think it's just too big of a threat to the American democracy. And if you listen to him very carefully, he wants to put up refugee camps. He wants the poor people from the country. It's very un-American. It'll be very disruptive for business continuity globally and in the U.S. So I'll be with President Biden if it's a Trump versus Biden case. But if it isn't, I'm a long term Republican, so we'll see."

        "title": "Cathie Wood on CPI Report, Fed Policy, Bitcoin ETFs - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nKathy, obviously CPI, you saw it cool across the board in October, both on headline and on core. And to say the least, the market reaction has been pretty swift. Curious to hear your thoughts, though, when you think about what this means for the Fed. Is it safe to say that we've seen the last Fed rate hike of this cycle? Well, first of all, I'll say I agree with almost everything Ken Griffin just said except his comments about the Fed. For some time now, we've been saying that the Fed has overdone it and that the greater risk here is deflation. Yes, the CPI did not surprise us at all, although there were rumors that revisions would take it higher than many people thought. And so we believe we're beginning to see deflationary trends in many more sectors. Now, it started with commodities. Now we're seeing airline prices coming down, auto prices coming down, and we're seeing staples prices. They have been sticky. But what's happened to Staples volumes, they have gone down. That's not how you run Mac manufacturing plants. So we think that they will be forced into cutting prices as well. You heard Home Depot today, -3.8% comp store sales here in the United States. And if you look at the S & P 500, I think a third of all companies in the S & P 500 are reporting negative revenue growth. What we have characterized the last two years as a rolling recession, some measures of housing are down 40%. That's a recession. How? Autos, 15 million units in the US. That's kind of punk. It's recession like. And we're seeing these volume declines in staples. Right. You've got consumers pulling back. So I think the Fed's overdone it. I think we're going to see a lot more deflation going forward. We are going to hit that two handle and we will go below it and would not be surprised to see CPI inflation negative at some point next year. Well, Kathy, is that materializes? Let's talk about how the Fed responds, because as we've been talking about, you have seen traders really pull forward their pricing for rate cuts next year. Add to that, what do you think this translates to in terms of magnitude of rate cuts that the Fed will have to deliver? Well, if we're right and they've gone way too far, they'll have to cut fairly significantly. I tweeted, although I don't know if I use the word tweet anymore on x I, I put a chart which showed the ratio of metals prices to gold prices and charted it against long term interest rates. We've never seen this big of a gap. The the metals to gold price indicator is saying deflation is the risk. It's down near the low end of a range. And the the long term treasury yield is way, way above where it should be. In fact, this metric would suggest if you just eyeballed the chart and it's not perfect, 2% would be the right level of rates. So I actually said that in my last in the no YouTube video, you know, 2% rate. That was the reason. Just looking at price signals that the Fed does not seem to be paying attention to. I'm curious, Kathy, about that. I mean, based on that and I remember seeing that chart and I've looked at that same ratio, I mean, that would imply that basically where we're at right now, you know, in the mid to high fours, I'll close to the 5% that we need to get back down somewhere around 2% here. And I can't really see how that happens without either a significant economic downturn or just what would just be an unprecedented pivot by the Fed. I think that I think we're in a rolling recession and it will continue. I think consumers are basically saying no mas when it comes to pricing. We're seeing that in volume numbers. And so if companies can no longer get pricing, what's going to happen? Their margins, which have held up, are going to get crushed. And we do think that's the case. Now, they've held on to employees who were very difficult to get during the rebound from COVID, reluctant to let them go because it was such a struggle to bring them on. I think that's going to change. They're going to be responding to margin pressures. And we do think you're going to see more unemployment during during the next three, six, nine months in an election year. So it will really get a lot of attention. Well, I'm curious as to what this means for our financial markets. I mean, let's just kind of go with this, that this is the hypothetical that the Fed remains behind the curve. They don't react enough and the economic consequences are severe even if it's not a recession. But they are severe enough that it significantly limits consumer spending and for that matter, even business spending. How does that sort of factor in, I guess, to the growth story with a lot of the stocks that I think so many people have embraced this year based on this idea that there was a longer term structural story in a lot of those names. How does that change, if at all? Well, I mean, I don't know if you're referring to our ilk of stock, where we're very focused on innovation platforms that are evolving today. And they're not immune from recession, but they are recession resistant and they're actually gaining more traction during tough times because they're better, cheaper, faster, more productive, more creative in terms of new products and services. So they gain more traction in tough times and then come out of a period like this flying. That has been the history in terms of strategies like ours that I think we've paid our dues 21 and 2221 our strategies were down just and the idea that interest rates might move up. And then in 22 they were crushed because interest rates moved up 22 fold more than they ever have in history, over little more than a year's time. And so we've paid our dues. I think the beginning of this year, the market started to say, okay, inflation is coming down. It peaked at nine, we're coming down. And we were coming down. We had a great year through July and a little bit of a setback as inflation fears picked up again. But I think today's report is very important in terms of look through there and see the price declines. You'll see a number of them. And this idea that deflation is spreading, I think is going to gain more currency during the next few months. And Kathy, to that point, take a look at the ARK Innovation ETF, currently up about 33% or so year to date. I want to switch gears here and talk about what everyone wants to hear about, and that is a potential US spot Bitcoin ETF. I know that you can't say too much about an active filing, but when you think about the process thus far and you think about potential timelines here, do you think that we're going to see spot Bitcoin approval spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US by year end, or is that a 2024 possibility? Well, we're looking at a change in the SEC's behavior. First and foremost, you know, when we put in our first few filings, they were rejected really out of hand. We got no questions. We had no interaction. That changed this year. And the SEC asked some really good questions. We know that the SEC, as certainly the research staff, is highly sophisticated in terms of understanding what could go right and what could go wrong. The questions were great. We answered those questions. So that was a change in behavior and we believe other other firms had the same experience. That was a change. And our deadline and we're the first in line, I would say, is January 10th. At that point, this is the final deadline. Either they approve or they deny. What we think could happen. And I'll give one caveat in a moment, is that by that time they will prove, but not just one. It will be a number of us because they don't want to pick winners. So so the caveat here is there is grayscale is out there. And there was some thought that the SEC would allow grayscale to convert from a grantor trust for Bitcoin to an ETF. Now, I don't know if that was grayscale's thought or conventional wisdom. There are rumblings that that might not be the case. Grayscale is public in saying that it will sue the SEC again if it is denied. So I don't know if that would hold to hold the timeline up, but if that were not to happen, I think we're getting close. And so, Kathy, just to make sure I'm understanding that. So if grayscale were to come out and sue the SCC again, that could actually maybe delay the process before that January 10th potential final deadline. It may or may not. You know, the SEC may feel it is standing its ground and this is these are the processes and procedures and grayscale needs to hew to them and just keep going or it may not you know, it is an uncertainty out there and just it's anyone's guess. And Kathy and talking about the ETF industry in September the news came about that Ark was buying rise ETFs. Now that is a European based ETF business and I've been wanting to ask you this basically since I wrote up that story. Why buy another asset manager to establish a European presence versus just going out and launching ARK ETFs organically? Well, a couple of things. First of all, the reason we did it was 25% of our subscriber base. Now we give our research away, but 25% of the readers are from Europe. We can we can see that. And the number one question probably for the last five or six years is why can't we? Why can't you issue a UCITS ETF in Europe? And so we started studying that as a strategic option and we realized Europe is a very complicated market. There is no way an American company, even a well-known brand in our space, can go into Europe and understand all the cultural nuances, all of the regulatory nuances, especially because sustainability in Europe is so important and they have Article nine, article age, their categories, and many companies declared themselves Article nine. So, you know, they were at the top of the heap in terms of sustainability. They 70% of them had to downgrade to Article eight. So there are new regulatory nuances. This company Ries now arc Europe, same DNA as ARC, very thematic in their focus, very future oriented. They self index their fund. So these are index strategies, but they know their stocks, unlike another index manager. Very often they won't know what's in the portfolio or if they do know, they won't know the management teams. This one is different and very similar DNA and did very well through the sustainability downgrades. Not one of their their funds was downgraded in that way."
