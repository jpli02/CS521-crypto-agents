        "content": "Bitcoin Price Could Reach $1.5 Million By 2030, Predicts ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood\n\nCathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Invest, has reiterated her bullish Bitcoin price prediction of $1.5 million by the year 2030. She cites the recent approval of the Bitcoin spot ETF in the US as increasing the \"probability of the bull case.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Wood went on CNBC and stated that her base case scenario sees Bitcoin reaching $600,000 by the end of the decade. However, under more optimistic conditions, Wood believes the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization could surge over 3,000% from current levels and trade at $1.5 million per coin. This revises her previous forecast of $1 million which she gave last year.\n\nWood points to Bitcoin's expanding fundamentals such as rising hash rate, increasing long-term holder reserves, growth in addresses holding BTC, and now the launch of the spot ETF as driving adoption and usage.\n\nThe SEC approval of ETFs backed by actual Bitcoins has been seen as a milestone event by the cryptocurrency industry. At least nine ETFs began trading on US stock exchanges yesterday, sparking immediate enthusiasm. Bitcoin prices shot up 9% in the first hour of trading on Thursday.\n\nARK Invest is one of the issuers licensed to operate a Bitcoin ETF. Wood claims that while the new spot ETFs will engage in intense competition, she expects the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin Trust ETF to emerge as one of the top performers.\n\nAs CEO of the high-profile ARK Innovation ETF, Cathie Wood has attained celebrity-like status in finance circles for her stakes in disruptive tech companies and digital assets like Bitcoin. It is estimated that nearly 25% of her net worth is invested directly in cryptocurrencies, underscoring her measurably positive outlook.\n\nOther forecasters also see a substantial upside in the Bitcoin price, although typically not to the same magnitude as Wood. Earlier this week, analysts at Standard Chartered Bank predicted $200,000 per Bitcoin by 2025 based on comparing the crypto asset's market with the advent of the first gold-backed ETF in 2004.\n\nWhile only time will tell whether Bitcoin reaches a multi-million dollar valuation, Cathie Wood remains an ardent believer in the network's long-term investment thesis. She stated that Bitcoin represents \"a financial super highway\" and \"public good\" that will expand from current levels as adoption continues increasing.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "title": "Bitcoin's Wall Street takeover frustrates crypto's true believers - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nThe price of bitcoin soared to its highest level in more than two years this week, as speculators bet that the first approved stock market funds for cryptocurrencies would open the door to a wave of new investors.\n\nBut some enthusiasts say the Wall Street takeover betrays their vision of crypto as an alternative financial system away from the prying eyes of government and mainstream finance, and cements bitcoin\u2019s status as merely a vehicle for speculation.\n\n\u201cThe founding principles of bitcoin and decentralised currency is really this cypherpunk, going against the grain, going against the big institutions,\u201d said Xavier Nukajam, a crypto start-up founder from the UK. \u201cIf you create this alternative and have to submit to what already exists . . . you\u2019ve failed.\u201d\n\nThat submission was underlined this week by the fanfare around the launch of bitcoin exchange traded funds, after more than 10 years of applications rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe funds enable investors to own bitcoin via a regulated vehicle listed on the stock market, without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. They are managed by established Wall Street giants including BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity \u2014 a far cry from largely unregulated exchanges such as the collapsed FTX and Binance, which was fined $4.3bn by US authorities last month for money-laundering and violating international sanctions.\n\nThe ETFs, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and CBOE Global Markets, racked up a collective $4.37bn of trading volume on their first day alone, according to CCData.\n\nFranklin Templeton, the asset manager, tried to underline its newfound crypto credentials by turning the eyes of Founding Father Benjamin Franklin in its logo into red lasers on social media \u2014 aping a popular meme denoting enthusiasm for bitcoin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very long journey,\u201d said Jean-Marie Mognetti, chief executive of asset manager Coinshares. \u201cBitcoin has graduated with distinction and is recognised as an investable asset class.\u201d\n\nBitcoin has travelled a long way since its invention by Satoshi Nakamoto \u2014 whose true identity has never been revealed \u2014 in 2008. His famous \u201cwhite paper\u201d described a payments system that stood apart from mainstream financial institutions, instead relying on the public record of blockchain technology.\n\nHe and his early adherents championed the countercultural ethos of \u201ccypherpunk\u201d, with its emphasis on the power of cryptography to protect an individual\u2019s privacy from the long arm of the state.\n\nHowever, that vision has struggled to get real-world traction. Bitcoin\u2019s use as a widespread tool for payments has been limited because it is too cumbersome and slow to verify transactions. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender in 2021, but consumers there have mostly shunned it.\n\nIts finite supply \u2014 the code that governs bitcoin allows only 21mn tokens ultimately to be created \u2014 led many to tout it as a hedge against inflation and the debasement of mainstream \u201cfiat\u201d currencies. That narrative took a hit last year when global inflation soared but the price of bitcoin tumbled.\n\nToday, such uses for bitcoin are mentioned more rarely. But its status as a speculative asset, albeit a highly volatile one, has been bolstered by its recent rebound and underlined by this week\u2019s fund launches.\n\nThe excitement surrounding bitcoin ETFs \u201cjust exposes how hollow the bitcoin narrative always was\u201d, said Hilary Allen, professor of law at American University Washington College of Law. \u201cAnyone who knew anything about economics or finance could have told you from day one bitcoin was never going to work as a payment system.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have been in this to make a quick buck and having \u2018number go up\u2019,\u201d Allen added, referring to a popular boast among crypto devotees about their market gains.\n\nUS regulators, nervous of the scandals that have plagued the crypto world in recent years, seem inclined to agree.\n\nAlthough the SEC approved the ETFs, chair Gary Gensler was keen to stress that the agency had been pushed into its decision by a US federal appeals court ruling last summer. \u201cWe did not approve bitcoin,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that underlying assets in other ETFs, such as metals, had consumer and industrial uses. \u201cBitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion and terrorist financing.\u201d\n\nFellow SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who dissented from the approval, warned that spot markets remained open to fraud and manipulation.\n\nStill, some in the industry see a newfound respectability for bitcoin, whose price has soared nearly 1,300 per cent over the past five years, far outstripping other assets.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the libertarian vision was frauds and the shitcoins,\u201d Andrew Bond, senior research analyst at Rosenblatt Securities, referring to smaller cryptocurrencies often launched to make a quick profit for their founders. \u201cIf you look at where there\u2019s been regulatory action, where there\u2019s been problems with the crypto space, it hasn\u2019t been bitcoin.\u201d\n\nCrypto advocates are hoping that the ETFs will boost the bitcoin price because the issuers will be required to buy the token on behalf of their customers. The coins will be held at a custodian, and the issuer will create and redeem shares to represent the owners\u2019 share of the pool.\n\nJad Comair, founder of digital asset investor Melanion Capital, bought his first bitcoin in 2013. \u201cYou had all these technological hurdles,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really worried about losing my phone and as a result losing my bitcoin forever. Now, you\u2019re in the hands of the biggest players in finance like BlackRock and Fidelity, and you know they\u2019re going to take all the necessary measures to safeguard people\u2019s assets.\u201d\n\nThe greatest impact may yet be on the crypto exchanges which have been the only option for people who want to hold bitcoin for the long term.\n\n\u201cThere will now be a bifurcated market in crypto,\u201d said Alison Jimenez, president of Dynamic Securities Analytics, a securities litigation consultancy. \u201cThose that still want to trade crypto will still go to these exchanges. Those that want to hold bitcoin as an investment will just take the simpler and more straightforward ETF route.\u201d\n\nFor some, the introduction of regulated third parties like custodians, exchanges, asset managers and market makers is an example of another emblem of a counterculture that became commoditised by mainstream finance.\n\nJames Angel, associate professor at Georgetown University, pointed out that alcohol and cannabis had once been illegal but have since become traded assets.\n\n\u201cIn the same way, bitcoin was seen as an outlaw outside of the respectable space of investments, and now it\u2019s taking its place in the old boys\u2019 club,\u201d he said. \u201cWall Street is really good at selling stuff, they\u2019ll sell anything they can make a buck on.\u201d"

        "content": "Shortly before the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wednesday night, it reissued a \"no FOMO\" warning to investors.\n\nThe warning not to invest over \u201cfear of missing out\u201d emphasized the volatility of digital assets, noting how trendy cryptocurrency investments go through extreme highs and lows, representing billions of dollars in gains \u2014 and losses.\n\n#SECInvestingResolution 5: Say \u201cNO GO to FOMO\u201d (fear of missing out).

Learn more about finding out what\u2019s right for you and your investing goals: https://t.co/fixDWoNFrF pic.twitter.com/SGf1z6xmhL \u2014 SEC Investor Ed (@SEC_Investor_Ed) January 6, 2024\n\nEven after Wednesday\u2019s announcement, SEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that despite the approval of the ETF listing, \"we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\"\n\nThe SEC\u2019s blessing brings industry standardization and regulation to digital asset investing. But financial experts urge caution, warning mainstream investors to tread carefully as bitcoin (BTC-USD) is still considered a speculative asset.\n\n\"From a very conservative financial perspective, you have to be very careful,\" Kiran Garimella, assistant professor at the University of South Florida Muma College of Business, told Yahoo Finance. \"If the financial instrument that's being traded doesn't actually represent anything of specific value underlying it, then you'd have to sit back and question that.\"\n\nBut first, what exactly is a spot bitcoin ETF?\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs are investment vehicles that track the performance of bitcoin. Investors purchase shares of the fund, which is managed by asset managers who hold the actual bitcoin and its immediate value (\u201cspot\u201d) as the underlying asset. Those managers make money on management fees and on the slim margin between the actual price of bitcoins (which fluctuates) and the price at which they sell the shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the value of the ETFs will move in tandem with bitcoin, the funds may be more stable as fund managers can utilize different financial instruments within the fund to soften the volatility.\n\n\u201cAn ETF not only makes it much easier to buy and sell and trade these bitcoins, it could also cover some of the strategic risk for you,\u201d Garimella said.\n\nThe world\u2019s first bitcoin originated in 2008 and is credited to a still-unknown person who used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. It was formed based on a free market, decentralized ideology where digital currencies are created, distributed, traded, and stored in a peer-to-peer ledger known as the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin's price has recently hovered around $46,500, surging to $49,000 at one point last week as reactions to the SEC approval played out. The value of a coin peaked at an all-time high in 2021 when the price surpassed $65,000. But it crashed to around $16,000 just 12 months later, as investors slowly lost confidence in the sector.\n\nShould bitcoin ETFs be part of your portfolio?\n\nThe highly anticipated SEC approval means that everyday investors can now own bitcoin in their investment or retirement accounts without having to buy digital tokens directly from a crypto exchange.\n\nThe crypto world is still opaque and out of reach to many Americans, but the 11 new spot funds are listed across the NYSE, CBOE, and Nasdaq \u2014 the same platforms where stocks, ETFs, and other traditional securities are bought and sold.\n\nGarimella said the new funds dramatically reduce the administrative risks of investing in bitcoin. Before, interested investors had to open up a \"wallet\" and use \"private keys\" just to own the tokens. Crypto exchanges themselves also carried risks, including hacking and fraud.\n\n\"Oh, boy, you'd have to go through hoops just to acquire a fraction of a bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency for that matter,\" Garimella said. \"Most people had no clue what a wallet or private key is.\"\n\nEven now, only the funds are standardized; a strategic risk is still associated with investing in a bitcoin fund.\n\n\"It's great if you can pull it off by investing in it at $5, sell it for $500, and make a lot of money,\u201d Garimella said. \"But can you be consistent and systematic, and can you come up with a strategy to capitalize on the value generated by that?\"\n\nBroad skepticism remains about crypto in general and its speculative nature. With such instruments, there is no intrinsic value backing the digital asset, only investors\u2019 belief that its price will go up.\n\n\"Cryptocurrency seems like speculation that central banking will be replaced \u2014 that maybe the US dollar is going to be replaced as the dominant reserve currency,\" Mark Higgins, CFA, CFP, and author of \"Investing in US Financial History,\" told Yahoo Finance. \"I am skeptical.\"\n\nThe Vanguard Group, the second-largest provider of ETFs, announced it has no plans to launch a spot bitcoin ETF or offer any crypto-related products.\n\n\"Our perspective is that these products do not align with our offer focused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio,\" the company said.\n\nOn the other side, Fidelity Investment, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, launched its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) on Thursday, calling the product an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve long believed a spot-priced exchange-traded product would be an efficient way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin,\u201d Cynthia Lo Bessette, head of digital asset management at Fidelity, said in a statement.\n\nYet, in a sign of how uncharted this territory is, Fidelity is requiring investors to execute its Designated Investment Agreement (DIA) when placing an order for the FBTC fund. The DIA certifies that the investors are experienced, have high risk tolerance, and can afford to lose some or all of their investment in the digital product.\n\nEleven of the largest financial asset managers in the world launched a Bitcoin ETF. (Chesnot/Getty Images) (Chesnot via Getty Images)\n\nStill, these ETFs could be a safer way to own bitcoins because asset managers can reduce the funds' risk through sophisticated tactics such as opening up futures contracts, hedging, putting in call options, and improving laddering strategy.\n\n\"When you have an ETF that does all of that stuff, it introduces a certain level of stability or risk management to that underlying instrument,\" Garimella said. \"In a crypto market, you're exposing yourself to a certain level of risk, which could be minimized with the right ETF.\"\n\nThe biggest appeal of bitcoin, the world\u2019s best-known cryptocurrency, is perhaps blockchains' future potential. The technology could transform monetary transactions, its backers believe. Personally, Garimella said he owns bitcoin from an educational perspective and may put more money into an ETF because the digital coin could link to a tangible asset class in the future, given the innovation in the space.\n\n\"But would I advise my grandmother to invest in it? Probably not,\" Garimella said.\n\nWhere to purchase ETFs and what fees to expect\n\nInvestors interested in diversifying their portfolio with digital assets can purchase shares in spot bitcoin ETFs through their brokerage accounts. The funds will be listed similarly to other funds and can be traded throughout the day for liquidity. The approved ETFs are fund products from big financial players such as Fidelity, Invesco, and BlackRock.\n\nSEC chair Gary Gensler said in a statement that despite the approval of the ETF listing, \"we did not approve or endorse bitcoin.\" (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) (Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images)\n\nMany firms have announced their fees for managing the ETFs. Blackrock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion in managed assets, is charging investors 0.25%, a decline from the 0.30% it previously set. Grayscale is charging 1.5%, while Franklin said it would waive management fees through August, a sign of how competitive this new market is.\n\nToday, bitcoin remains the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization \u2014 $913 billion as of Jan. 11.\n\nRebecca Chen is a reporter for Yahoo Finance and previously worked as an investment tax certified public accountant (CPA).\n\nClick here for the latest personal finance news to help you with investing, paying off debt, buying a home, retirement, and more\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
