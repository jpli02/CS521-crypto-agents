        "title": "Babylon v0.7.1 Goes Live With Smart Contract Capabilities and Bitcoin Security for dApps - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Equipping developers with the tools to build decentralized applications whilst tapping into unmatched Bitcoin security\n\nPalo Alto, California --News Direct-- Chainwire\n\nBitcoin security sharing protocol Babylon has successfully deployed a major upgrade to its testnet. V0.7.1 of the network introduces comprehensive smart contract capabilities built using the popular CosmoWasm and Wasmd framework. It allows developers to extract security from Bitcoin to secure their applications and blockchains by deploying Babylon smart contracts.\n\nThe community has been eagerly anticipating this upgrade ever since Babylon's initial testnet launch four months ago. During this period, Babylon's testnet has drawn significant interest and integrated with 28 of the top Cosmos SDK chains, including Osmosis, Akash, Sei Network, Injective, Evmos, and Stride, thereby demonstrating traction for its technology. The integration arguably makes these Cosmos chains the most secure PoS chains in the world, as the solution combines the best of both worlds, Proof of Stake (PoS) & Proof of Work (PoW) security mechanisms. Additionally, channeling the value of PoS ecosystems into the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade extends Babylon's capabilities beyond the Cosmos ecosystem, enabling it to cater to a broader range of applications. It positions Babylon as a robust platform for developing decentralized applications for all verticals, especially DeFi, NFTs, and GameFi, where security is top priority.\n\nDavid Tse, Co-Founder of Babylon, said: \u201cWe are thrilled to announce the launch of Babylon v0.7.1, introducing the integration of smart contracts. This marks a crucial milestone for Babylon, turning it into a powerful platform for deploying a wide range of protocols, thereby facilitating the development of decentralized applications secured by the strength of the Bitcoin network.\n\nThis upgrade also paves the path to a spectacular Bitcoin-centric ecosystem. Babylon is leading the R&D of advanced scaling and security sharing protocols to fully unleash the potential of Bitcoin. Through Babylon smart contracts, the mighty power of Bitcoin will be readily at the disposal of the applications built on Babylon.\n\nStory continues\n\nBabylon recently announced the pioneering Bitcoin Staking Protocol, which enables Bitcoin the asset to be staked and used to secure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains. This is achieved without altering the Bitcoin blockchain nor any bridging. In return, participating Bitcoin holders can earn rewards for contributing to the security of PoS networks.\n\nAbout Babylon\n\nBabylon is a project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world. Babylon\u2019s origins come from a research paper about Bitcoin security co-authored by co-founder of Babylon David Tse, a professor at Stanford and Ethereum 2.0 researcher, and the founder of EigenLayer Sreeram Kannan, and their colleagues. The project is led by a team of consensus protocol researchers from Stanford and experienced layer 1 engineers from around the world.\n\nBabylon's mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world. To achieve this, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world,. To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol. Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.\n\nLearn more: https://www.babylonchain.io/\n\nContact Details\n\nShalini Wood\n\nswood@babylonchain.io\n\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/babylon-v0-7-1-goes-live-with-smart-contract-capabilities-and-bitcoin-security-for-dapps-728634553"

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether rose during Monday afternoon trading hours in Hong Kong, while most of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization declined. Risk appetite remained low after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance and Coinbase two weeks ago.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Crypto lawsuits, Hinman and a rare rate hike pause\n\nBitcoin, Ether gain, most top 10 cryptos drop\n\nBitcoin rose 0.5% from 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$26,442. Ether gained 0.46% in the same timeframe, to US$1,724.\n\nBitcoin, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency, rose above US$26,000 on Saturday to a seven-day high of US$26,769 after it had slumped to three-month lows at the end of last week.\n\nCrypto investor appetite remains cautious since the SEC initiated legal action against Binance and Coinbase two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cPerhaps this recent behavior will lead to a restructuring of the SEC with a new person in charge,\u201d Mike Brusov, co-founder of crypto intelligence firm Cindicator, wrote in a statement shared with Forkast.\n\n\u201cNew leadership would then usher in positive changes for crypto regulations and present a major step forward in the development of the crypto industry. The new administration would confidently spark further innovation and assist with the expansion of the crypto space within the United States.\u201d\n\nNew York-based crypto exchange Bakkt has suspended trading of Polygon, Solana and Cardano tokens and plans to delist them, according to Fortune on Friday. Trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro have also decided to delist multiple cryptocurrencies following the SEC\u2019s lawsuits.\n\nCardano\u2019s ADA token was the day\u2019s biggest loser in the top 10, falling 2.36% in the past 24 hours to US$0.2601, followed by Polygon\u2019s Matic token that lost 1.62% to US$0.5983.\n\nThe XRP token saw the biggest gain, rising 0.95% to US$0.4884. The token saw some upside momentum since last week after the release of internal SEC documents showing former director William Hinman saying that Ether was not a security. Investors hope this would prove that XRP was unfairly targeted by the regulator, in the SEC vs XRP lawsuit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization over the past 24 hours fell 0.33% to US$1.07 trillion and market volume decreased 1.2% to US$19.92 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nEthereum NFT sales drop as Bitcoin ordinals sales gain ground\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched down 0.11% to 2,878.67 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong and declined 4.39% during the week.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour non-fungible token (NFT) sales fell 19.8% to US$10.51 million, as sales for the largest Ethereum-native collection, the Bored Ape Yacht Club, fell 47.76% to US$665,168. Mutant Ape Yacht Club sales also declined 18.99% to US$541,976.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 49.52% to US$2.19 million, boosted by $FRAM BRC-20 NFTs that rose 5641% to US$556,055, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nNike took the NFT industry by surprise on Friday, after it posted a teaser video for the \u201cultimate Sneakerhunt\u201d starting on June 20 on the popular massively multiplayer online game Fortnite, which could signal an upcoming NFT collection. The apparel firm has released digital apparel on Fortnite in the past.\n\nLooking at the day\u2019s most notable NFT sales, LBT #6 sold for US$600,000 while LBT #7 sold for US$200,000.\n\nAsian equities strengthen along with most U.S. stock futures\n\nSource: Envato Elements\n\nMajor Asian equities strengthened as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong after investment banking giant Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for China\u2019s 2023 GDP to 5.4% from 6%. The development comes after JPMorgan, Bank of America and UBS also downgraded their expectations for the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 1% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index slipped 0.64%. The Shanghai Composite decreased 0.54% and the Shenzhen Component Index inched down 0.29%.\n\nU.S. stock futures were in the green except the S&P 500 futures index that fell 0.39%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures inched up 0.004% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.75%. The U.S. stock market is closed Monday for a public holiday and will open on Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rose 0.24% to 102.5 points, while the euro fell 0.23% to US$1.09. The U.S. dollar fell 1.2% last week after the Federal Reserve paused interest rate hikes for the first time in over a year. Markets are now expecting another 25 basis points rate hike in July and a halt after.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on July 26 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 28.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in July, and a 71.9% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\n\nSee related article: Crypto industry reacts to SEC\u2019s lawsuit against Binance\n\n(Updates with equities section)"
