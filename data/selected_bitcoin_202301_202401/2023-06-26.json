        "content": "Digital-asset investment products added $199 million last week, the biggest weekly inflows in nearly a year, as a flurry of applications for spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US sparks renewed interest in the space.\n\nThe inflows are the highest since July 2022 and follow nine consecutive weeks of outflows, according to a report from digital asset manager and crypto research firm CoinShares. About $187 million, or 94% of the total flows, went to Bitcoin. Total assets under management now stand at $37 billion \u2014 the highest since before the collapse of Three Arrows Capital, the data shows."

        "content": "Bitcoin Cash, one of the early offshoots of the original digital currency, has more than doubled in value over the past week.\n\nThe surge began after a new crypto exchange backed by firms including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets and Charles Schwab Corp. said it\u2019s gone live. EDX Markets, an institutional-only exchange announced in September 2022, will offer trading in four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. BlackRock also applied for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund this month, adding to optimism that the long-sought fund would finally gain regulatory approval."

        "content": "More than $3 million worth of Bitcoin just moved after 13 years of dormancy. Two wallets holding 50 BTC each, mined back in 2010, were moved to different wallets.\n\nIt is unclear who the owners of the cryptocurrency are but they are the sixth and seventh whales to have moved large quantities of BTC this year.\n\nThe movements come as the price of the largest digital asset soars following renewed institutional investor interest. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up nearly 15% in seven days, trading hands for $30,381, according to CoinGecko.\n\nThe term \"whales\" refers to investors who hoard huge amounts of Bitcoin and don\u2019t touch it for years.\n\nSuch investors\u2014also known as \u201cHODLers\u201d\u2014are the most successful. Those who buy BTC and sell it quickly usually lose out, while those who buy it and sit on it for years tend to make a profit.\n\nThis is because Bitcoin experiences short-term volatility but in the long-term its price has appreciated massively. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap back in July 2010 was worth a fraction of a cent.\n\nDr. Kirill Kretov, a developer of tools for automated trading and blockchain analyst, previously told Decrypt that Bitcoin mined back in 2010 was probably down to computer experts experimenting with the technology but that it was hard to know whether the Bitcoin had since landed in the hands of commercial entities.\n\n\"There is this unique spirit of crypto anarchy and technological pioneering behind such elder addresses,\" Kretov told Decrypt. \"It's like a way-back machine, and thousands of people are left to speculate about why those bitcoins were transferred now.\"\n\nHe also mentioned that there's a theory that \"elder\" whale wallets shift BTC to send each other signals about when it's time to pump the price of the world's oldest and largest cryptocurrency.\n\n\"There are some researchers who take notes on price charts about those awakenings, trying to predict the future price,\" he said. \"Luckily, I'm not one of those.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOther whale movements include a holder in April who hadn\u2019t touched their coins for a decade shuffling $7.8 million-worth of BTC to new wallets.\n\nNumber of Bitcoin Whales Drops to Lowest Level Since 2019\n\nAnd just last week, a long-term investor moved 50 BTC after 11 years of inactivity to a new wallet."

        "title": "Wall Street backing crypto in bitcoin ETF push - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Wall Street players are now backing crypto as institutional investors show support for bitcoin ETFs. Yahoo Finance crypto reporter David Hollerith checks out bitcoin's year-to-date performance and the outlook for bitcoin ETF approval.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n[AUDIO LOGO]\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Crypto prices lower today but momentum has been strong this year. And now some of the biggest names in finance are making new bets on cryptocurrencies adding competition and momentum to the space. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has more on that story. And David, nothing like a boost of confidence from Wall Street to get investors bullish on crypto again.\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Akiko, the big finance player moves that we've seen in the last two weeks obviously started with BlackRock filing an ETF. We also saw ETX markets begin trading. And they're backed by Fidelity Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities. And that's a new crypto exchange that doesn't interact with individuals but serves more like a traditional exchange.\n\nAnd then we have Deutsche Bank also applying to custody crypto assets. And outside of BlackRock, a lot of these moves were previously telegraphed as far back as a year. But obviously, this came at a really good time, I guess you would say for the space, just given that a lot of this year so far the story has been regulatory enforcements in the US leading to lawsuits. And that's still a lot of what we're looking at to determine where things are going.\n\nRegulation, of course, in the US is a really big deal. But we've seen obviously-- the Bitcoin price has surged a lot and then the total crypto market cap has followed along with that. And we've seen even just higher inflows into Bitcoin associated exchange traded products. So there's a lot of enthusiasm about this. Most of it actually was previously reported but I think that it highlights-- it's a reminder that cryptocurrency hasn't gone away as much as it might seem sometimes.\n\nAnd we see earlier this month, in fact, the SEC filing charges against the two largest crypto exchanges in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: And David, to that point, at least up until this point when you take into account the massive run that we've seen in the price of Bitcoin up what about 80% year to date. It hasn't yet had a massive impact but I guess you can make the argument that it's coming off a very depressed level after the implosion of FTX. But what do you think are the key things that investors need to watch for when they're trying to figure out where Bitcoin, where crypto is headed in the second half?\n\nDAVID HOLLERITH: Yeah. Always a good question. I think it's fair to think about it this way, which is that regulation has really dominated cryptocurrency asset prices. Maybe Bitcoin the least but still Bitcoin has sagged on bad regulatory news. So regulation is still going to be a major focus. But as things get cleared up, at least I think with the BlackRock and ETX announcements, there's a signal that US businesses or financial institutions, I should say, are still interested in getting involved in the space.\n\nAnd I think that brushes aside some of it. That being said, from what I've heard from crypto hopefuls in Washington, it sounds like there are two bills that are getting ready to be voted on in the House in July. And I've heard optimistically that one of those two bills could be passed in the House by the end of the year. There's a lot less optimism for what could happen in the Senate.\n\nAnd then that being said, the most important lawsuit as far as the ETF goes is the Grayscale lawsuit. Grayscale is suing the SEC for not approving its spot Bitcoin ETF or approving a conversion of its existing product. So the verdict for that case comes out at the beginning of September, and that's going to be really important. And we don't have the exact information, we don't know, but it'd be hard to imagine that the SEC would even consider approving an ETF before that verdict is reached.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: I know you'll be following those developments closely, David Hollerith, thank you."
