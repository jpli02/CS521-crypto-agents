        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cryptocurrency markets were trading in the red on Tuesday after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against Binance, accusing the exchange giant of violating securities laws.Bitcoin (BTC) declined 4% to $25,764, whereas Ethereum (ETH) was below the $1,850 level. BTC volume stood at approximately $20.32 billion, rising 76% in the last 24 hours.\"The latest development between Binance and SEC has spooked the global crypto market resulting in a bloodbath across digital assets. The market will respond sharply as the Binance-SEC saga unfolds; we should brace ourselves for a choppy market in the coming weeks. Regulatory clarity is the need of the hour for the global crypto ecosystem,\" Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said.The world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which alleged in a June 5 court filing that the firm operated a \"web of deception\" that included artificially inflating its trading volumes and commingling customer funds.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also sued Binance over regulatory violations in March.Other top crypto tokens were also trading lower. BNB and Solana declined by over 7%. Meanwhile, Dogecoin XRP , Cardano, Polygon and Polkadot also traded with cuts. The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading lower around $1.09 trillion, falling 4% in the last 24 hours.The total volume in DeFi is currently at $3.46 billion, which is 7.5% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $43.78 billion, which is 94% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.The market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was around $499 billion. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is currently 45.78%, a decrease of 0.08% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.\"The sell-off in crypto markets as a reaction to US SEC suing Binance has brought Bitcoin to its 3-month low. There is a strong confluence of support for BTC at the $25,200 range that will likely hold to form a 'higher low' for the asset and provide a bounce for the next leg up.

        "title": "Bitcoin Is Less Than a Year Away From a Much-Hyped Event That Has Historically Seen Its Price Soar - Nasdaq",
        "content": "***Money is not a client of any investment adviser featured on this page. The information provided on this page is for educational purposes only and is not intended as investment advice. Money does not offer advisory services.***\n\nThe crypto market has been laying somewhat low in 2023 compared to its massive price swings that made constant headlines in recent years.\n\nBut we\u2019re now less than a year out from an event that has historically seen bitcoin\u2019s price rise during the lead-up and aftermath: bitcoin halving, which happens once every four years.\n\nThe regular event limits the amount of new bitcoins that come to the market. Because of the historical gains around bitcoin halving, some investors are hoping that the next halving, expected in April or May of 2024, could spur the start of a crypto bull run (a period of prices going up). That would be welcome news for investors, given thatbitcoin prices\u2014 along with those of other financial assets, like stock prices \u2014 have taken a hit in the last year amid interest rates hikes and recession fears.\n\nBut can we actually expect a price boost as we head towards the next halving? Here\u2019s what crypto investors should know.\n\nWhat is bitcoin halving?\n\nBitcoin halving has everything to do with bitcoin miners, who are involved in the process of creating new bitcoins. That includes everyone from individual hobbyists to corporate enterprises, with anywhere from one to thousands of specialized computers. These computers work constantly at the singular task of solving mathematical problems for the bitcoin network. If a computer solves a problem, it is rewarded with the bitcoin that is minted as a result of its work.\n\nBitcoin halving causes the total reward that miners receive for their work to be slashed in half. Miners currently earn 6.25 bitcoin for solving a problem, but they will begin to receive only 3.125 bitcoin for their efforts after the halving. From its very inception, bitcoin\u2019s creator only ever intended for the supply to reach 21 million coins \u2014 and the goal of the bitcoin halving is to decrease the supply of new bitcoin overtime.\n\nMuch of the rhetoric around halving as a cause for a crypto rally has to do with this tightening of rewards. Many investors see the event as increasing scarcity of bitcoin and say it will inflate the coin\u2019s value because of supply and demand economics.\n\nBitcoin halving has historically come with price gains\n\nSo far, there has been a bitcoin halving in 2012, 2016 and 2020 \u2014 and each one has seen the price of bitcoin rise in the months before and after the event.\n\nFollowing the 2016 halving, for instance, bitcoin\u2019s price jumped to a record of nearly $20,000 per coin in 2017. In the year leading up to the May 2020 halving, bitcoin\u2019s price rose around 20%. Between the halving and the end of the year, bitcoin\u2019s price gained more than 200%.\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of how bitcoin\u2019s price will do in the future, but there\u2019s already chatter about the halving\u2019s potential as fuel for a new price run.\n\nWill there be a crypto bull run?\n\nSome crypto experts are challenging the notion that the bitcoin halving is going to bring on a prolonged bull market. Crypto is still relatively new, so nothing should be taken as a certainty, says Omid Malekan, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School. He adds that when it comes to the bitcoin network, nothing changes for anybody during a halving except for miners: There\u2019s a misconception that the halving reduces the overall supply of bitcoin, but it really just reduces the amount of new bitcoin coming on the market, Malekan says. The plan is that there will still ultimately be 21 million coins, as was always intended. Plus, the halving is no surprise.\n\n\u201cYou would think [halving events] would be priced in long before the actual event and not have any material impact,\u201d Malekan says.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of back and forth about whether or not the halving is baked into bitcoin\u2019s price, and whether the fact that bitcoins are scarce make them more valuable. Morningstar senior research analyst Madeline Hume\u2019s recent analysis of bitcoin scarcity indicates that the argument that increasing the scarcity of new bitcoin pushes up its value is reductive. Hume notes that bitcoin looks on charts like its pricing operates in four-year cycles, which seems to indicate a correlation between scarcity and price increases. But she also notes that, excluding the \u201choneymoon periods\u201d that followed previous halvings, the relationship between the production of new bitcoin and prices is more or less negligible.\n\n\u201c[It could] be pure coincidence that bitcoin\u2019s halving cycles arrived just as narratives around crypto reached their frothy peaks, and the relationship is totally spurious,\u201d Hume says. She goes on to also say that a major flaw in these scarcity-based analyses is that they all predict bitcoin\u2019s price will keep going up, which is impossible to know.\n\nCould the bitcoin halving cause prices to drop?\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the bitcoin halving could actually cause the cryptocurrency\u2019s price to go down, Malekan says. The slashing of miners\u2019 rewards will make the practice less profitable and miners who are already struggling could be forced to shut down when their potential profits are cut in half, Malekan says. This could hurt the network\u2019s security since there would be fewer people monitoring activity.\n\n\u201cA lot of miners are suffering during this bear market and unless prices recover or fees go substantially higher, some will be forced to shut down once the block reward falls,\u201d Malekan says.\n\nIf there are gains, don\u2019t expect them to be long-lived\n\nHanna Halaburda, an associate professor at NYU Stern School of Business, says that post-halving gains are nothing more than hype, and that while prices may go up in the near-term, investors shouldn\u2019t expect a long-lasting bull market thanks to the halving alone.\n\n\u201cThe only real explanation for why the price goes up is that we start talking about bitcoin more,\u201d Halaburda says.\n\nThe halving, like many happenings in the world of crypto, gets a lot of social media chatter in its lead-up. Halaburda points to studies that say there is a relationship between social media posting and crypto price fluctuations. (Nowadays, a tweet from Elon Musk can send dogecoin\u2019s price soaring.) She adds that newer investors learning about the coin\u2019s limited new supply could help along a short-lived speculative rally, since they may have not been aware of the halving before.\n\nHalaburda also says investors need to keep in mind that the halving won\u2019t do anything to improve the use cases for bitcoin, which is ultimately what matters most for ensuring the longevity of the network.\n\nMore from Money:\n\n\u2018Free\u2019 Games Like Candy Crush and Counter-Strike Are Wrecking People\u2019s Finances\n\nCrypto Graveyard: Thousands of Coins Listed in Recent Years Have Already Failed\n\nStock Ownership Is at Its Highest Level Since 2008\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2023 Money Group, LLC.
