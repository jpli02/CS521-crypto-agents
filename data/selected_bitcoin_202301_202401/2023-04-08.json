        "content": "What now seems to be more relevant than ever is that the defendants in the case included Ray Youssef and Artur Schaback, the co-founders of Paxful, a website that allowed users to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) on a peer-to-peer basis, similar to eBay (EBAY) or Craigslist. The company, founded in 2015, had grown to employ more than 200 people in four offices around the world, with $5 billion traded on Paxful by more than 12 million users over the course of its existence, according to court filings."

        "content": "A bill seeking to regulate Bitcoin (BTC) mining activity in Arkansas has passed in the state\u2019s House of Representatives and Senate. The bill will now move to the governor\u2019s office for approval.\n\nAccording to the bill, the Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 intends to regulate the Bitcoin mining industry in the American state, creating guidelines for miners and protecting them from discriminatory regulations and taxes.\n\nArkansas\u2019 state legislators quickly passed the bill after it was proposed on March 30 by Senator Joshua Bryant. The document recognizes \u201cthat data centers create jobs, pay taxes, and provide general economic value to local communities.\u201c\n\nArkansas Data Centers Act of 2023. Source: Arkansas State Legislature\n\nAs per the approved bill, a digital asset miner is required \u201cto pay applicable taxes and government fees in acceptable forms of currency and operate in a manner that causes no stress on an electric public utility\u2019s generation capabilities or transmission network.\u201c\n\nUnder the legislation, crypto miners will also have the same rights as data centers. The bill outlines that Arkansas\u2019 government should not \u201cimpose a different requirement for a digital asset mining business than is applicable to any requirement for a data center.\u201c\n\nRelated: Crypto mining in 2023 \u2014 Is it still worth it? Watch Market Talks\n\nArkansas\u2019 move follows a similar initiative in the state of Montana. In late March, the Montana Senate passed a bill to protect crypto miners operating within the state. The bill intends to protect miners against taxes on digital assets used for payments, and to eliminate energy rates discriminating against home crypto miners and digital assets businesses.\n\nThe state of Texas went in a different direction. Its Senate Committee on Business and Commerce passed legislation on April 4 that would essentially remove incentives for miners operating under the state\u2019s crypto-friendly regulatory environment, Cointelegraph reported.\n\nAn even more decisive move came from New York in November 2022 when Governor Kathy Hochul signed the proof-of-work mining moratorium into law, banning crypto-mining activities in the state for two years. On a federal level, crypto miners in the United States could eventually be subject to a 30% tax on electricity costs under a budget proposal introduced on March 9 by President Joe Biden aimed to \u201creduce mining activity.\u201d\n\nMagazine: US enforcement agencies are turning up the heat on crypto-related crime"

        "content": "Bitcoin Q2 Fundamental Outlook\n\nBitcoin prices enjoyed a 60% rally in the first quarter, allowing the largest cryptocurrency to recover a fair portion of last year\u2019s losses. As fears of financial instability continue to drive risk sentiment, Bitcoin prices have surged and could continue to be driven by the same systemic risks in the second quarter.\n\nIn Q2 of 2023, the main factors to watch are:\n\nRecession fears (rising risks of a recession could be a major headwind for speculative assets if the banking sector regains confidence).\n\n(rising risks of a recession could be a major headwind for speculative assets if the banking sector regains confidence). Inflation and monetary policy (ECB and the Federal Reserve have reiterated their intention to raise rates in inflation remains elevated).\n\n(ECB and the Federal Reserve have reiterated their intention to raise rates in inflation remains elevated). Financial regulations imposed on digital currency and a potential Lawsuit between the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) and Coinbase (one of the largest crypto exchanges). Depending on the developments and the outcome, this could be another risk factor to monitor closely.\n\nWill Systemic Risks Make or Break Bitcoin?\n\nAfter a strong start to 2023, prices rallied nearly 40%, before settling at a key level of technical resistance around the September 2022 high of $22,781. As Fed expectations continued to drive sentiment, a robust labor market and persistently high levels of inflation opened the door for the Federal Reserve to consider raising rates more aggressively.\n\nStocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, to a certain extent, do not earn interest, so a high-interest rate environment does not bode well for these non-yielding assets. After a series of aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022, markets had expected the pace of monetary policy tightening to ease. However, as the Fed and the ECB remained fixated on fulfilling the objectives of the dual mandate (to achieve full employment and price stability), inflation remained well above the 2% target. This caused both major central banks to consider hiking rates more aggressively to tame price pressures.\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nWill Contagion from the Banking Crisis Continue to Support Digital Assets?\n\nHowever, following the collapse of SVB (Silicon Valley Bank), Signature Bank, and the ongoing problems at First Republic Bank, pressure mounted on the Fed to consider pausing its rate cycle.\n\nAlthough the financial sector remains vulnerable to contagion that could result in an increase in the number of bank failures, the probability of additional rate hikes has been reduced. Instead, many expect the Fed to announce rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\nSource: Refinitiv\n\nAs a result, the combination of the eroding credibility of the banking sector, a weaker US Dollar, and a potential Fed pivot has boosted the appeal of digital assets. As Bitcoin and its major counterparts continue to monitor the geopolitical backdrop, fundamentals will likely remain as the primary catalyst for price action. With prices currently trading at their highest level since June last year, both technical and fundamentals could assist in driving the prominent trend."

        "title": "Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High For The 4th Time In 2023: Here\u2019s Why - NewsBTC",
        "content": "Bitcoin mining difficulty continues to break records despite the struggles of BTC to surpass the $30,000 resistance mark. The leading coin has attracted the interest of miners in recent months due to the price recovery experienced since the turn of the year.\n\nBitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits New Record\n\nBitcoin mining difficulty moved to an all-time high on April 6, 2023, following the most recent mining difficulty adjustment on its blockchain network. The mining difficulty rose for the fourth consecutive time and reached 47.8 trillion, an increase of 2.3%.\n\nThe Bitcoin mining difficulty automatically adjusts every 2,016 blocks \u2013 approximately two weeks \u2013 to maintain the 10-minute block creation time. There has been a steady increase in mining difficulty in recent weeks, with the last downward trend recorded on February 11.\n\nOne of the consequences is reflected in the hash price, which is the rate of profit miners make for the hashrate they provide to the Bitcoin network. In theory, a higher mining difficulty leads to a lower hash price. This is because more miners are contributing computing power than normal, leading to more competition for the rewards that the Bitcoin network provides miners that produce new blocks on the network.\n\nRelated Reading: Buckle Up! Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal An Impending Rollercoaster Ride\n\nFurthermore, the Bitcoin hashrate or processing power can indicate the degree of mining difficulty. At the time of the mining difficulty adjustment that preceded the latest one, BTC\u2019s hash rate was at a record high leading to increased mining difficulty.\n\nHowever, this has changed recently, with the hashrate falling by an average of 20 EH/s this week. It should be noted that Bitcoin\u2019s hashrate varies as measured by different sources. For example, BTC.com places the metric at 338 EH/s, and mempool places this at a slightly higher metric of 347/ EH/s\n\nBullish Market A Major Reason For Increased Mining Difficulty\n\nBitcoin has appreciated by more than 50% since the start of 2023, leading to calls for a bullish market. Unsurprisingly this positive trend has led to many miners reconnecting their equipment after a difficult 2022.\n\nRelated Reading: Uniswap Who? Trader Joe\u2019s AMM Takes DeFi By Storm\n\nThe collapse of Terra Luna and subsequent fallout from FTX led to significant bearish pressure on the market, with several coins taking steep price declines. Bitcoin was one of the coins to dip, leading to a difficult year for miners, with many having to sell their equipment or shut down operations to stay afloat.\n\nHowever, the bull run of 2023 has raised expectations from miners that the market could be on its way to previous levels. Nonetheless, the crypto mining sector has not been without its difficulties, with friendly places like Texas in the United States planning to tighten regulations on electricity that could affect the booming sector soon.\n\nFeatured image from unsplash, charts from mempool and Tradingview.com\n\nDisclaimer: The article is provided for educational purposes only.

        "title": "What's a Better Buy: Bitcoin or Ethereum? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "The debate between Bitcoin (BTC 0.53%) and Ethereum (ETH -0.42%) as a better investment has been a hot topic in the cryptocurrency community for years. Both are popular and established cryptocurrencies, but there are key differences between them that make Bitcoin a better investment. The reason for this belief can be boiled down to three simple reasons.\n\n1. The market cap difference\n\nMarket capitalization, or \"market cap,\" refers to the total value of a company or asset. In the case of cryptocurrencies, it is calculated by multiplying the total number of coins in circulation by the current market price of each coin. As of April 1, 2023, Bitcoin has a market cap of over $545 billion, while Ethereum's market cap is just under $220 billion.\n\nEssentially what this means is that Bitcoin is currently a more established asset than Ethereum and makes up a disproportionate amount of value in the entire crypto asset class. As of today, Bitcoin accounts for more than 45% of all the value in crypto.\n\nIts higher market cap indicates that it has more adoption and more trust among investors. Additionally, it suggests that Bitcoin is less volatile than Ethereum, as it would take a larger amount of money to move its price significantly.\n\n2. Increasing scarcity\n\nOne of the most significant differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their supply. Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, which means that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins in circulation. Currently, there are around 19.3 million circulating, with the remaining 1.7 million yet to be mined. Even better, though, these remaining 1.7 million bitcoins will be released at a diminishing rate for the next 117 years until the last bitcoin is mined.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin's inflation rate is a minimal 1.7%. However, due to the gradual decrease in the rate of new coins being created, it is estimated that by 2056, this number will fall below 0.1%. By the year 2100, Bitcoin's inflation rate will be somewhere around 0.000001%. No matter the asset, an inflation rate this low helps to ensure that prices are not only maintained but grow as demand competes for a more limited supply.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has no hard cap. While it does have a mechanism known as burning to remove ether from circulation, there is, technically, no overall limit on the number of ether which could enter the market. Unlike Bitcoin, this means that Ethereum is subject to unknown levels of inflation, which can decrease the value of each individual coin over time.\n\n3. Decentralization and security\n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin has a stronger track record when it comes to security and decentralization. Bitcoin's blockchain is the most secure and decentralized of any cryptocurrency, with thousands of nodes and miners around the world helping to verify transactions and maintain the network. This makes it less susceptible to hacking or manipulation than Ethereum, which has had several high-profile security incidents in the past. Additionally, Bitcoin's decentralized nature means that it is not subject to the same level of centralization or regulation as Ethereum, which has been criticized for being too closely tied to its founders and developers.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin has a more established and secure network than Ethereum. Bitcoin's network has been operating securely for well over a decade, and its underlying proof-of-work technology has proven to be reliable and resistant to attacks. Ethereum, on the other hand, has had some security issues in the past, including a major hack in 2016 that resulted in the loss of millions of dollars worth of ether. While Ethereum's security has improved over time, it still lags behind Bitcoin in terms of reliability and security.\n\nKeep it simple\n\nWhile Ethereum might be deserving of a spot in your portfolio, Bitcoin provides investors with a safer and more dependable option. Likely the greatest advantage Bitcoin has over Ethereum is its simplicity. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and easy to understand: it is a highly decentralized and secure digital store of value that provides holders with reliability.\n\nEthereum, on the other hand, has a more complex value proposition that is tied to its smart contract functionality and decentralized applications. While this complexity can be appealing to some investors, it also makes Ethereum more difficult to understand and evaluate as an investment, as many of these use cases are in their beginning stages.\n\nFor investors looking to keep it simple and wanting to invest in cryptocurrency, look no further than the original digital asset, Bitcoin."
