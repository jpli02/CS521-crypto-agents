A breach could dictate its price trajectory. A break below $29,200 could lead to support at $29,000 and $28,750, which would maintain the bearish trend. Conversely, a break above $29,600 could push it to $29,800, with $30,000 and $30,200 providing significant resistance.

        "content": "Bitcoin prices fell on Wednesday afternoon trade in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Notably, BNB, the native token of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, added to its weekly drop after the company announced the closing of its cryptocurrency payment service Binance Connect. Investor concerns remained on edge following Fitch Ratings\u2019 downgrade warning on Tuesday for dozens of major U.S. banks including JPMorgan.\n\nSee related article: TradFi has its eyes on crypto, and here\u2019s the real reason why: Opinion\n\nBitcoin dips; Binance faces heat\n\nBitcoin dropped 0.69% to US$29,160 in the 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.18%, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin has been trading below US$30,000 since last Wednesday. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency\u2019s trading volume gained 8.71%, but its market capitalization lost 0.84% to US$567.23 billion in the past 24 hours.\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s earlier reputation as a highly volatile asset attracted traders who thrived on rapid price swings. With the decrease in volatility, such opportunities for substantial short-term gains have become less common,\u201d said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an emailed statement on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor investors who thrive on volatility, the calmer waters of the Bitcoin market can feel limiting. They must adapt their strategies to the new normal, focusing on longer-term trends and holding positions for extended periods,\u201d Green added.\n\nBNB, the native token of the largest crypto exchange Binance, fell 1.92% to US$234.66, logging a 4.17% weekly decline. Binance said it will shut down its cryptocurrency payment service Binance Connect on Wednesday, due to \u201cchanging market and user needs.\u201d\n\nBinance filed a protective court order against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, seeking to restrict the agency\u2019s \u201coverbroad\u201d requests for information. The SEC sued Binance, its U.S. platform, and Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao in June for alleged breach of securities laws.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization fell 1.31% to US$1.16 trillion, while market volume climbed 22.48% to US$32.08 billion.\n\nDeGods sales drop, but tops rankings\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.14% to 2,471.55 over the 24 hours leading up to 7.10 p.m. in Hong Kong, but posted gains of 0.23% on the week.\n\nAt the same time, Forkast\u2019s Ethereum NFT and the Polygon NFT indexes gained, while the index measuring Solana NFTs declined.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume dropped 2.16% in the past 24 hours to US$15.79 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Total NFT transactions also dropped 9.78% to US$565,906.\n\nNFT sales volume on Ethereum dropped 7.97% to US$9.14 million, although the network topped CryptoSlam\u2019s sales volume rankings.\n\nAmong collections, Ethereum-based DeGods topped sales rankings with US$1.23 million, although it was 37.85% lower than the previous day.\n\n\u201cClearly collectors have lost some faith in the DeGods team after fumbling the DeGods Season III art release, and the announcement of moving y00ts again from Polygon to Ethereum,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nMythos-based DMarket ranked second, rising 8.33% to US$1.01 million, while Polygon\u2019s DraftKings ranked third after its sales volumes climbed 52.19% in the past 24 hours to US$771,722.\n\nAsian bourses, U.S. stock futures fall; European equities mixed\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nMost Asian equity markets were down on Wednesday. China\u2019s Shenzhen Component, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei, and South Korea\u2019s Kospi dropped at the end of trading hours, following lackluster economic data coming out of China.\n\nThe country\u2019s economic activity data for July \u2014 retail sales, industrial output and investment \u2014 all came in lower than expected, raising concerns about the health of the world\u2019s second-largest economy. The People\u2019s Bank of China on Tuesday unexpectedly cut loan rates by 15 basis points to 2.5%, the steepest cut in three years.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s cyclical soft patch keeps deepening. Data from a wide range of indicators, including credit growth, investment in capital markets and properties, industrial production, retail sales, construction, exports, and manufacturing and agricultural product prices reveal an overall loss of economic momentum,\u201d Singapore-based DBS bank said in a research report on Monday.\n\n\u201cIn addition to lackluster economic data, a long-simmering threat to economic and financial stability, the intersection of weak property market prices and a mountain of debt in the sector, is causing considerable concern,\u201d DBS added.\n\nU.S. stock futures dropped as of 8.30 p.m. in Hong Kong with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures, and the Nasdaq 100 futures all in the red.\n\nRatings agency Fitch has warned of a downgrade for dozens of major U.S. banks including JPMorgan. The agency also downgraded the United States\u2019 long term credit rating from AAA to AA+ earlier this month citing long-term macroeconomic concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, annual headline inflation in the United Kingdom dropped sharply to 6.8% in July from 7.9% in June, the lowest level since February 2022 and matching market expectations. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, remained unchanged from June at 6.9%, and slightly above expectations of 6.8%.\n\n\u201cThe plan that we are executing on is clearly working, but we need to keep with that plan, keep making responsible decisions when it comes to public finances, and we need to make sure that fiscal policy is aligned with monetary policy at the Bank of England,\u201d Gareth Davies, exchequer secretary at the U.K. Treasury, told CNBC on Wednesday.\n\nEuropean bourses were mixed on Wednesday, with the benchmark STOXX 600 falling while Germany\u2019s DAX 40 strengthened during afternoon trading hours in Europe."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell on Thursday morning in Asia, along with other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos. Bitcoin briefly dipped below $28,500, while Ether\u2019s losses took it below the psychologically important $1,800 threshold. Smaller altcoins such as Dogecoin, Solana and Ripple suffered the biggest drops. In more bullish news, Coinbase Global received approval to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors. The Forkast 500 NFT Index was down, although market sentiment remains positive amid a prolonged increase in global transactions. U.S. equity futures traded mixed after another day of losses Wednesday. The release of the minutes for July\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting on interest rates has cast a shadow over equities, the mood music now suggesting a prolonged period of elevated rates or even another hike.\n\nAnother down day for crypto\n\nBitcoin fell 0.95% in the last 24 hours to US$28,551.83 as of 9:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, after briefly falling below the $28,500 threshold earlier in the morning. The largest crypto by market capitalization logged a weekly loss of 3.51%, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nEther also lost 1.80% to US$1,794.91 \u2014 below the psychologically important $1,800 level \u2014 for a 3.28% drop in the past seven days.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies were down. Dogecoin was the biggest loser among the top 10, dropping 5.01% to US$0.06731 for a weekly loss of 10.07%. Solana followed in terms of losses, dipping 4.25% to US$22.83. The token fell 5.98% in the past week.\n\n\u201cLarger currencies have seen less pressure than smaller altcoins,\u201d wrote Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at London-based online brokerage FxPro, in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cRising U.S. Treasury yields put pressure on riskier assets,\u201d Kuptsikevich explained.\n\nThe losses arrive in the midst of more positive news for the crypto market.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coinbase Global \u2014 the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. \u2014 announced that it has received approval from the National Futures Association to offer crypto futures to U.S. retail investors. Previously, only institutional customers could trade crypto futures on the platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoinbase called it a \u201cwatershed moment,\u201d celebrating the win despite facing securities violation charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nMajor moment for crypto regulatory clarity in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThis has been a multi-year process toward approval, and we're excited to finally be launching federally regulated crypto derivatives with margin to our U.S. customers.\n\n\n\nWhen there is a clear path to register, we do. https://t.co/TxSOAIpoPj \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) August 16, 2023\n\n\u201cThey now have an approved, compliant [Futures Commission Merchant status] and they understand the nuances of crypto markets,\u201d wrote Chris Perkins, president and managing partner at New York-based investment advisor CoinFund.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important step forward in cultivating deep, liquid derivative markets \u2014 which are very much needed. This should be very good for Coinbase, and excellent for crypto markets,\u201d Perkins added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP token also lost 3.66% to US$0.5862, posting a weekly loss of 8.08%. On July 13, Ripple appeared to score a victory in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. A New York court ruled that the sale of XRP on public exchanges does not violate securities laws.\n\nHowever, that aspect of the case is again under scrutiny as, on Aug. 9, the SEC asked for a review of the ruling \u2014 contributing to the downward pressure on XRP\u2019s price.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved down 1.47% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion, while trading volume rose 13.64% to US$33.76 billion.\n\nDaily NFT transactions hit historic levels\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index fell 0.76% in the past 24 hours to 2457.08 as of 08:45 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index shows a 1.23% loss for the week.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Cardano NFT indexes logged losses, while the index for Polygon gained.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 7.72% in the past 24 hours to US$15.01 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Polygon and ImmutableX blockchains logged losses, while volume on Solana and Mythos gained.\n\nOn Wednesday, the total number of global NFT transactions reached a new milestone, marking an all-time high of 617,619, up from 595,209 on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe NFT market is maturing right in front of us and we\u2019re hitting historic levels on a daily basis,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\n\u201cSales volume isn\u2019t my measure for how healthy the NFT ecosystem is, it\u2019s the buyers, sellers and it\u2019s transactions,\u201d said Petscher. \u201cI am so bullish on NFTs right now.\u201d\n\nMuch of that optimism, Petscher said, is based on a decline in NFT prices, with the average price of a single NFT now US$22.08, down from US37.85 a week earlier.\n\n\u201cAverage sale prices, I want to point out again they continue to decline and that\u2019s a very, very good thing. We want to bring in the masses. We want our friends and families to come into NFTs,\u201d Petscher added.\n\nDMarket, a collection linked to Mythos network-based blockchain games, topped the NFT collections chart by trade volume on CryptoSlam, adding 0.45% to US$970,811.\n\nEthereum-based DeGods came in second despite a 38.75% slump to US$922,882. The collection recently launched its \u201cSeason 3\u201d collection update on Sunday. New-entry The Heist, an NFT collection based on the strategy game of the same name, placed third with a trade volume of US$756,980.\n\nFed minutes signpost potential hikes ahead\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell | Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 10:45 a.m. in Hong Kong following a decline across all three major indexes during regular trading Wednesday.\n\nWednesday\u2019s release of the minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting has put a dampener on investor sentiment. The discussion revealed concerns among Fed members that additional interest rate hikes may be needed to control inflation.\n\nThe minutes stated that \u201cwith inflation still well above the Committee\u2019s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary policy.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of the meeting minutes, analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool gave a 13.5% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in September, up from 9.5% on Wednesday. The Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia \u2014 China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 and South Korea\u2019s Kospi \u2014 all posted losses on Thursday morning, echoing bearish sentiment in the U.S.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite fell 0.15% to around 3,145, its lowest level since early January. That reading combined with weak economic data and the nation\u2019s ongoing property sector debt crisis points to a downturn in the Chinese economy.\n\n\u201cProlonged weakness in property construction will add to destocking pressures in the industrial space and depress consumption demand as well,\u201d said Tao Wang, economist at UBS Investment Bank, according to Reuters.\n\n\u201cIn such a case, economic momentum may stay subdued in the rest of the year and China may miss this year\u2019s growth target of around 5%,\u201d Wang added.\n\nChina has also stopped releasing youth unemployment data after the figure hit a record high of 21.3% in June. The suspension follows a string of downbeat economic reports in China, including retail sales and industrial output, raising fears about a slide into recession.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. retail giant Target reported a slump in quarterly revenue. The US$24.77 billion in Q2 was lower than the estimated US$25.16 billion. However, Target shares still added 2.96% on Wednesday.\n\nMajor U.S. retailer Walmart is set to release its quarterly results on Thursday.\n\n(Updates with equities section.)"
