        "content": "Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the crypto exchange will indeed add support for the Lightning Network, one of the biggest endorsements yet for the blockchain that makes bitcoin (BTC) a more realistic option for payments by dramatically speeding up transactions.\n\nThe company had said in early August that it was looking into Lightning support. On Wednesday, Armstrong said on X (formerly Twitter) that this review was over and Coinbase has \u201cmade the decision to integrate Lightning\u201d\n\nThe team did a great job digging into this, and we've made the decision to integrate Lightning. Bitcoin is the most important asset in crypto and we're excited to do our part to enable faster/cheaper Bitcoin transactions. Will take some time to integrate so please be patient. https://t.co/FneeXkLI25 \u2014 Brian Armstrong \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f (@brian_armstrong) September 13, 2023\n\nHe also took the time to praise bitcoin, calling it \u201cthe most important asset in crypto.\u201d Back in August, when discussing the Lightning review, he had said: \u201cI\u2019m all for payments taking off in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nLightning is a layer-2 blockchain associated with the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin transactions can be offloaded there for more efficient \u2013 and much faster \u2013 processing, a prerequisite if BTC has a shot at eventually becoming a common method of payment.\n\n\u201cBitcoin is the world\u2019s digital monetary system, and Lightning is Bitcoin\u2019s payments layer,\u201d Cathie Wood, the head of Coinbase\u2019s second-biggest shareholder, ARK Invest, wrote on X in response to Armstrong\u2019s post Wednesday. \u201cCoinbase\u2019s integration with Lightning will give its 100 million users an on-ramp to faster and cheaper bitcoin transactions. Hats off to Coinbase!\u201d\n\nCoinbase\u2019s stock was recently up 1.4% following the news.\n\nArmstrong said that while his team is working on integrating Lighting, it will take some time to do so."

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMajor cryptocurrencies traded mix on Wednesday amid a nearly flat greenback. Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $25,879.58, up 0.80% while Ethereum (ETH), Tether USDt, BNB , USD Coin, XRP gained up to 0.69%.Other crypto tokens such as Cardano, Dogecoin , and Solana fell up to 1.07%.ETH was trading at $1,582.98, up 0.33% while Dogecoin was at $0.06067, lower by 0.17%.Cryptocurrencies have an inverse relationship with the US dollar. The dollar index was trading at 104.67 with a slightly negative bias.In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained by 0.57% while ETH is down by 2.28% during this period, Rajagopal Menon, Vice President, WazirX on the Crypto Market said. \"The Exponential Moving Average for 10-day EMA indicates 'Buy' in BTC at $25,858 and 200-day EMA indicates 'Sell' at $27,005. Meanwhile, 10-day SMA indicates 'Buy' at $25,817 and 200-day SMA indicates 'Sell' at $27,655,\" Menon said.Edul Patel, CEO & Co-Founder of Mudrex attributes the price surge in Bitcoin above $25,900 to renewed interest in the Bitcoin Spot ETF race. He said that Franklin Templeton, a major player in the asset management industry, has submitted an application to the US SEC, which could have caused this positive market sentiment. \"Notably, the number of wallets holding 0.1 BTC reached an all-time high of 12 million recently, which suggests growing trust among investors in Bitcoin. Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to trade around the $1600 mark,\" Patel said.Among the top gainers, MKR rose 125%, followed by OMG with a 35% increase, ZIL with 26%, REEF with 10% and BTG with an 8% gain, Sathvik Vishwanath, Co-Founder & CEO, Unocoin informed while highlighting biggest losers as ENS which is down 69%, WAVES down 64%, COTI down 38%, GNS down 28% and REP down 26%.On the strategy front, Vishwanath said, \"Bitcoin technical analysis reveals strong bullish trend. Primary technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average of Convergence (MACD) indicate a favorable buying zone. Additionally, the 50-day exponential moving average supports a continued bullish trajectory as long as Bitcoin remains above $25,600. A decline below this level could test the support at $25,400 and the critical $24,950 level. Conversely, a break above the $26,500 resistance may target the $27,000 and $27,500 levels\".(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Why Blackrock Wants High Bitcoin (BTC) Price, SEC\u2013Ripple Lawsuit Cost Ripple (XRP) 3 years of Adoption, an - The Economic Times",
        "content": "In this article, we will explore the reasons why Blackrock is aiming for a higher Bitcoin (BTC) price, how the SEC-Ripple lawsuit has cost Ripple (XRP) three years of adoption, and finally how Tradecurve Markets has experienced a boom in growth over the past few months. Let's look at each of these topics in more detail.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets <<\n\nTradecurve Markets (TCRV)\u2019s Stellar Surge: 150% and Rising\n\nAs Tradecurve Markets transitions into its fifth phase, the token price climbed to $0.025, with more than 35 million being acquired in just one week.\n\nSo, what's fueling this excitement? At its core, Tradecurve Markets is an avant-garde trading platform envisioned to meld the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges. By seamlessly integrating the prime features from both trading environments, Tradecurve Markets resonates with a diverse spectrum of traders.\n\nA standout aspect of Tradecurve Markets is its versatile trading palette, enabling transactions across a diverse set of assets. Be it cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, or corporate stocks, traders can consolidate and oversee their investments on a singular platform.\n\nYet, the real USP of Tradecurve Markets is the removal of cumbersome KYC/AML formalities, empowering traders to embark on their journey with minimal hassle. All it takes is an email registration and an initial cryptocurrency deposit for traders to get started.\n\nGiven these innovative features, it's clear why market analysts are earmarking Tradecurve Markets as a formidable contender against the likes of established giants such as Binance and Kraken. With the road ahead looking bright, there's a palpable sentiment that TCRV's value might soar well beyond the $1.00 mark in due course.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) ETFs and the Market's Jitters\n\nBitcoin has recently slumped from $31,800 to under $26,000 after delays to Bitcoin ETF approvals. Market participants are now commenting that Blackrock wants a lower Bitcoin price before they enter the market.\n\nThe perception that a depressed Bitcoin price would allow BlackRock to rake in higher profits upon the ETF launch may seem logical at first glance. However, diving deeper into the mechanics and implications makes the idea less straightforward.\n\nBlackRock, an esteemed global financial institution, has always prioritized market stability and the trust of its investors. Deliberately benefiting from a significant dip in Bitcoin's value could risk the broader reputation and acceptance of the crypto market.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps a watchful eye on any signs of market manipulation while ensuring robust investor protection. Any suggestion that BlackRock might be involved in manipulating Bitcoin's price would not only tarnish its reputation but could also derail its attempts to secure regulatory green lights for its ETFs.\n\nRecent price action suggests that Bitcoin buyers were overly bullish on the initial ETF news by leveraging margin positions. The subsequent lack of bullish updates caused the price to dip under support, where a long squeeze began.\n\n>>Register For The Tradecurve Markets <<\n\nRipple (XRP)'s Legal Quagmire: Setbacks and Surges\n\nIn a recent statement on X (previously known as Twitter), renowned attorney John Deaton lamented the significant opportunity cost the SEC\u2013Ripple lawsuit had on Ripple (XRP).\n\nThe legal battle has cost Ripple three years of adoption, technology development, and establishing relationships with global partners. Other crypto projects have taken this time to make significant progress in their respective areas, leaving XRP far behind them.\n\nHighlighting the peculiar nature of the lawsuit, Deaton also referenced MoneyGram's association with Ripple. MoneyGram, a global leader in payment processing, had no backlash from the SEC regarding a decision to leverage Ripple.\n\nYet, despite adherence to due diligence and transparency by Ripple's partners, the SEC opted to initiate a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, ushering in an era of uncertainty and setbacks for XRP in the U.S. market.\n\nPrice-wise, the news that Ripple won the SEC case sent the token soaring by over 100% in a single day. However, that full move has fully retraced and Ripple is back trading under the $0.55 support/resistance.\n\nFor more information about the Tradecurve Markets (TCRV):\n\nWebsite: https://tradecurvemarkets.com/\n\nhttps://app.tradecurvemarkets.com/sign-up\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nThis is an advertorial.

        "content": "Bitcoin rose on Thursday morning in Asia to trade above the US$26,000 support level. Ether also rose to reclaim US$1,600. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies moved up, with Solana spearheading the winners with a 24-hour rise of over 2%. The rally followed the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) release on Wednesday, which showed an acceleration in the annual inflation rate in August, while the core CPI that excludes food and energy prices posed a deceleration. U.S. stock futures traded higher, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin reclaims US$26,000; altcoins stable after bankrupt FTX received approval to liquidate\n\nBitcoin rose 1.45% in the last 24 hours to US$26,251.64 as of 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong, adding 1.88% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the US$26,000 support level on Wednesday afternoon and touched a daily high of over US$26,370 on early Thursday morning.\n\nDespite reclaiming the key US$26,000 line, Bitcoin\u2019s momentum has seemingly weakened on Tuesday, but is \u201cstill strong enough to hold on to most of what was reclaimed after the bounce,\u201d Keith Alan, co-founder of monitoring resource Material Indicators, tweeted on Wednesday.\n\nBitcoin still faces multiple technical resistances, including a \u201cdeath cross\u201d between the token\u2019s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages \u2013 which currently sit at US$27,444 and US$27,670, as well as a 100-day moving average at US$28,292 that outlines the ceiling of the range, according to Alan on Tuesday.\n\nEther also gained 0.95% to US$1,609.32 but still traded 1.64% lower in the past seven days. The second top crypto reached a 24-hour high of US$1,619.11 on Tuesday night.\n\nBitcoin and Ether prices briefly dipped on early Thursday morning in Asia after the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX received court approval to sell its US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. The selling is capped at US$100 million per week, which can be extended to US$200 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nFTX\u2019s current crypto holdings include US$1.16 billion in Solana\u2019s SOL and US$560 million in Bitcoin, according to a Monday court filing.\n\nDespite the incoming FTX liquidation, crypto prices remain largely stable. All other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains in the past 24 hours. SOL led the winners, which rose 2.70% to US$18.43 but lost 6.70% for the week.\n\nVisa wrote in a Tuesday research report that Solana blockchain \u201chas attributes like high transaction throughput and scalability at low cost that help make it a good candidate for payments and Visa\u2019s stablecoin settlement pilot.\u201d The global payment giant announced a partnership with Solana on Sept. 5 to expand its USDC stablecoin settlement pilot to Solana\u2019s blockchain\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.07% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion, while trading volume dropped 21.30% to US$27.63 billion.\n\n\u201cThe recent stability could be attributed to steady CPI data, as is common amongst high-risk asset classes,\u201d said John Stefanidis, CEO and co-founder of blockchain infrastructure DAO, Balthazar DAO.\n\n\u201cMoreover, it seems the crypto market may have already priced in the potential ramifications of FTX\u2019s approved sale of its substantial $3.4 billion crypto asset portfolio,\u201d added Stefanidis.\n\nU.S. annual inflation rate accelerates\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading higher as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, after Wall Street closed mixed on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite logging gains while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging lower.\n\nMost main stock indexes in Asia rose on Thursday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all logged gains, while China\u2019s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.03%.\n\nThe U.S. CPI release on Wednesday sent mixed information to the market. The inflation gauge rose 3.7% by year in August, an acceleration from 3.2% in July. The August CPI also booked a monthly gain of 0.6%, the biggest increase since June 2022.\n\nThe accelerated CPI growth aligns with analysts\u2019 expectation, according to Reuters on Thursday. Gasoline price, which jumped 10.6% in August, accounted for over 50% of the CPI growth in the month.\n\nMeanwhile, the core CPI \u2014 which excludes the volatile food and energy prices \u2014 rose 4.3% by year in August, a deceleration from 4.7% in July and the smallest reading since September 2021.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing here to seriously put a Fed rate hike on the table next week, but there is enough to keep the debate about the need for one more hike in 2023 alive,\u201d Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at U.S.-based investment bank Brean Capital, told Reuters.\n\nGiven the mixed CPI data, J.P.Morgan Asset Management wrote on Wednesday it expects the Federal Reserve to make no further interest rate hike in this monetary tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cDespite still rising oil prices in early September, we expect the impact of oil price spikes on CPI to be limited,\u201d J.P.Morgan\u2019s Chief Global Strategist David Kelly said in a note viewed by Reuters, who expects the annual inflation rate will fall below the Fed\u2019s long-term goal of 2% by the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 97% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in its meeting on Sept. 20, which is currently in the range between 5.25% and 5.50%. It gives a 58.4% chance for another pause in November, up from 56.8% on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. August producer price index (PPI) is set to be released on Thursday, with analysts expecting the data to rise 1.2% by year, up from 0.8% in July. The data will provide further insights into the Fed\u2019s future monetary policies.\n\n(Updates with equity section, comment from Stefanidis.)"

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 September 13, 2023 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Coinbase COIN, MicroStrategy MSTR, BlackRock BLK, Marathon Digital MARA and ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF BITO.\n\nBitcoin's Untapped Potential: Institutional Adoption\n\nThe revolutionary invention of Bitcoin came from a humble 2008 white paper by a pseudonymous person or people named Satoshi Nakamoto. The idea was simple yet powerful \u2013 create a digital, decentralized, secure network resistant to a single point of failure. Through the years, Bitcoin has seen some major tests, including (but not limited to):\n\nThe 2008 Financial Crisis\n\nBitcoin went live slightly after the largest recession in more than 100 years.\n\nMt. Gox Collapse\n\nEarly in Bitcoin\u2019s existence, Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world and handled around 70% of Bitcoin transactions. However, in early 2014, Mt. Gox was hacked, and the exchange lost approximately 850,000 Bitcoins belonging to customers, equating to hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nFTX Bankruptcy\n\nFTX was one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, but in 2022, regulators discovered that its founder Sam Bankman Fried, allegedly mishandled customer funds. Soon after, Fried was arrested, and FTX was forced into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nBitcoin Resilience\n\nBitcoin is known for having ardent haters and religious followers. Nonetheless, despite the shockwaves these and other events sent through the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin itself has survived. Through thick and thin, Bitcoin has continued to function as a decentralized digital currency, and its price eventually recovered. Since its inception, Bitcoin\u2019s average annual return has been stunning \u2013 230% annually (well above the S&P 500 and pretty much every asset). Bitcoin is now worth $510 billion \u2013 well above most Fortune 500 companies.\n\nInstitutional Adoption: A Major Catalyst that Hasn\u2019t Come to Fruition (Yet)\n\nIf you missed the meteoric Bitcoin returns, is the juice still worth the squeeze? The answer is yes. Bitcoin has achieved stunning returns without major institutional investors being involved. Below are 3 catalysts that will send Bitcoin and Bitcoin proxies even higher:\n\nStory continues\n\nLegal Clarity\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is locked in major lawsuits against crypto players. Recently, XRP altcoin parent Ripple scored a historic court win over the SEC. The court ruled that XRP is not an offer of unregistered securities. That\u2019s potentially good news for Coinbase, the largest US crypto exchange that is currently entangled in a similar lawsuit with the SEC.\n\nNew Accounting Standards\n\nRecently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changed corporate accounting rules \u2013 a move that will help crypto-centric companies like MicroStrategy. MSTR, one of the largest Bitcoin holders, can now alleviate undesired perceptions associated with holding Bitcoin. Furthermore, the new standards will allow banks to take custody and lend against Bitcoin \u2013 a significant win for the industry.\n\nSpot ETF Approval\n\nCurrently, no spot Bitcoin ETF exists in the United States. As the name implies, a spot ETF is a mechanism to invest in Bitcoin \u201con the spot.\u201d The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF,a non-spot Bitcoin ETF, is underperforming Bitcoin itself dramatically year-to-date.\n\nHowever, BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, has applied for a spot Bitcoin ETF, along with others. With that in mind, the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF seems inevitable (out of more than 500 applications, BLK has only had one rejected in its history).\n\nSlowly, Then All at Once\n\nAfter years of failures, the Bitcoin and crypto industry is inching closer to regulatory clarity due to recent court victories, new accounting standards, and the potential for a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Regulatory clarity will clear the way for institutional adoption. If institutional adoption is to take place, clear winners would be Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin proxies such as Marathon Digital and Coinbase, which will benefit from increased trading from institutions and custody of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhy Haven\u2019t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.
