        "content": "He\u2019s now CEO of Bitcoin Depot, the world\u2019s largest bitcoin ATM operator, which he founded three years after that first crypto purchase. The company went public in July \u2013 listing its shares on Nasdaq after a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) \u2013 and now Mintz says he\u2019s seeing slimmer profit margins for mom-and-pop operators as competition heats up. The crypto ATM sector is teeming with nearly 40,000 machines worldwide, about 6,400 of which belong to Bitcoin Depot. Consequently, the 29-year-old executive \u2013 whose company now has access to the capital markets \u2013 says he\u2019s willing to buy out the little guy."
