        "content": "Anticipation of an eventual US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund has helped to spur inflows into digital-asset investment products for a ninth consecutive week, the largest run since the crypto bull market in late 2021.\n\nThose products, such as trusts and exchange-traded products, saw inflows of $346 million last week, with Canada and Germany contributing to 87% of the total, according to CoinShares. Only $30 million came from the US, a sign of continued low participation from the country, the asset-management firm said in a report on Monday."

        "content": "ARK's Grayscale Share Sale Signals Bitcoin ETF Optimism\n\nIn the latest sign of increasing optimism for a spot bitcoin approval, ARK Invest, the asset-management firm led by famed investor Cathie Wood, shed about $5 million worth of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) shares last week, amid a narrowing of the trust\u2019s discount to 8.06%, its lowest in over two years as of Nov. 24.\n\n\n\nThe investment firm\u2019s ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) sold about 163,000 shares in the past week, according to data from Bloomberg. The sales came as the price of bitcoin, which has nearly doubled this year, temporarily surpassed $38,000 for the first time in about a year and a half.\n\n\n\nDespite ARK offloading the shares, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas clarified in a post on the X social-media platform formerly known as Twitter that he doesn\u2019t think the move indicates a lack of bullishness on the part of ARK.\n\n\u201cWith ARK you gotta look at weightings history before you begin interpretation,\u201d he tweeted in response to what he said was \"another article on how ARK is selling GBTC and how that means they aren\u2019t really bullish on BTC and/or they making room for ARKB. Neither is true.\"\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF Race\n\nLast week, ARK was the first of the major firms to disclose a fee for their prospective spot bitcoin ETF, according to a filing.\n\nMany firms have recently added updates to their spot bitcoin ETF filings, including WisdomTree Investments on Nov. 16, signaling that conversations with the Securities and Exchange Commission are steadily progressing toward a potential approval.\n\nThe SEC, which delayed its decision in September, must decide on ARK's application by Jan. 11, the earliest deadline for a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nWhile the SEC has approved cryptocurrency ETFs that track digital asset futures, the largest being the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the agency has thus far denied and delayed its decision on applications for ETFs that track physically backed cryptocurrency on the grounds of market manipulation. Despite investors excitement for a spot fund, the SEC has continued to delay its decisions on applications, most recently punting on a filing from Brazilian cryptocurrency firm Hashdex.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) resumed its rally in November before taking a dip earlier last week. However, the cryptocurrency rebounded to hit a new high for 2023 on Nov 24. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, hit the $38,000 mark for the first time this year on Friday.\n\nThis is the first time the cryptocurrency has traded past the $38,000 mark since May 2022. This year has been great for the cryptocurrency market after a disappointing 2022, with Bitcoin leading from the front.\n\nBitcoin finally settled just above $37,400. The recent rally marks the resurgence of cryptocurrencies. Not only Bitcoin but also other cryptocurrencies have made a solid turnaround this year.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has gained 126.2% year to date, Ethereum (ETH) closed above $2,070 on Friday and has now surged 74.2% year to date. Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have jumped 57.5% and 10.3%, respectively, year to date.\n\nThere have been several factors contributing to the cryptocurrency rally. One major factor is the resolution of legal issues faced by Binance.\n\nChangpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges.\n\nThis resolution has restored confidence among investors, alleviating concerns about the exchange's future and is also helping the broader cryptocurrency market stabilize.\n\nMany now believe that with the Binance investigation resolved, the path for a Bitcoin ETF approval will now be clear. Market participants believe that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is likely to play a major catalyst in driving the cryptocurrency market to new highs.\n\nSeparately, the Federal Reserve has maintained its hawkish approach and the minutes of the November FOMC meeting suggest that officials are still open to more hikes. However, as of now, they are more inclined toward maintaining a cautious approach.\n\nInvestors are, however, confident that the Federal Reserve will refrain from hiking interest rates in December as inflation declined further in October. Higher interest rates usually have an adverse effect on growth-focused sectors like technology, consumer discretionary industries, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc.

        "title": "Bitcoin may reach $57K over pending ETF approval: Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Crypto investors are awaiting Security & Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, which could unlock a surge of capital investment in the crypto space. However, this isn't the first time that crypto news created a stir of hype around digital assets, but is this time truly different?\n\nMarkus Thielen, DeFiResearch.com Head of Research, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what this ETF approval could mean for bitcoin and the crypto space, and why he feels that if approved, it could potentially reach a high price target.\n\n\"I think, to put it in numbers, there's around $120 billion US dollars in precious metals ETFs in the US, so that means in gold and in silver, and if you just move 10-20% of those and shift them over into bitcoin you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow,\" Thielen says. \"And we calculated this might have an impact of every $1 billion dollars of 4% impact on the price , so we might actually see kind of a price towards $57,000.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Now, Marcus, this isn't the first time that we've been waiting for this, you know, a big catalyst for bitcoin. And as you talk about the spot bitcoin ETF, other countries that have launched it didn't see a massive rally. Why will this time be different?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Well, the US is, of course, the largest pool of capital. And of course, ETFs are only really established in the US. You know, we have seen this a long time, you know, in Asia, how Asia tried to establish ETFs. But people don't really use them, and I think this is because the investor base is very different for the US market than anywhere else.\n\nAnd the US is really dominated by a lot of institutions. And those institutions are using ETFs really in their asset allocation. Of course, we have the registered investment advisor community, and estimates vary from-- you know, they managed 5 trillion to even more. But if they move like one of those-- 1% of those 5 trillion, that's like 50 billion into bitcoin, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd I think that could have like a big impact because we sort of can calculate if the market cap changes, you know, what might be the implications for the price of bitcoin. And what has really changed is really that we have, you know, certain judges telling around the-- telling the SEC around the grayscale lawsuit to go back and reevaluate their estimates.\n\nWe're having BlackRock as, you know, the largest asset manager in the world also filing for a bitcoin ETF. So I think the pressure is really building. And then there is an overall sentiment that the market had that the US regulatory regime is trying to clean up the market. So-- and the last missing piece in this puzzle was for example to sort of like eliminate an exchange from the US market that has been known and admitted to had, you know, illicit trading going on.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Marcus, you said even if one of these bitcoin ETFs move that could have a big impact. We're looking at bitcoin roughly at $37,000 right now. What does that move look like? How much higher can it go?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: Yeah. I think, you know, we have we have heard a false rumor that proved not true where bitcoin rallied 10%, you know, literally in a heartbeat. So we would estimate if a if a spot bitcoin ETF would be approved. Bitcoin could go up easily 20%. And I think you know to put it in numbers, there's around $120 billion USD in precious metals ETFs in the US. So that means in gold and in silver.\n\nAnd if you just move you know 10, 20% of those, shift them over into bitcoin, you know, you have certainly sort of something in the range of like $25 billion of inflow. And we calculated this might have actually an impact of every $1 billion, a 4% impact on the price. So we might actually see kind of a price towards kind of 57,000 we calculated we can see if there an approval for the bitcoin ETF.\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: 57,000 in the medium term?\n\nMARKUS THIELEN: In the medium term, yes. I mean, it sounds reasonable, right, when you look at-- you know, we were just at 25,000 like two months ago, and now we're at 37,000. So this is just literally like you know sort of like 12,000 rally that we had, so another 12,000 point rally. You know, it gets us already like two to the 50,000 point area.\n\nSo I think this can easily happen. And again, as I said, if you if you put in kind of the macro tailwinds of the fed pausing, if you compare to the 2017 episode when the CME announced the bitcoin future, I mean, I think there is just a lot of tailwind, and I think there's a lot of pent up demand. And you know, don't forget we have all these ETF providers. They are, of course, doing a lot of marketing. There are a lot of educational.\n\nAnd, you know, Larry Fink as the CEO from blackrock is almost you know every other day on TV and saying how important the bitcoin ETF is. So I think there is a coordinated marketing effort now to really bring prices higher."
