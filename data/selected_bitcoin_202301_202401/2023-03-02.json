        "content": "Xapo is partnering with Lightspark to allow its customers to send bitcoin near-instantaneously to any vendor who accepts BTC over Lightning.\n\nGibraltar-licensed private bank Xapo Bank has partnered with Lightspark, the startup spearheaded by former Facebook crypto lead David Marcus, to integrate the Lightning Network and enable near-instant bitcoin payments for its customers.\n\nXapo Bank members can now make small purchases of up to $100 USD at any vendor that accepts Lightning payments, without high transaction fees and long blockchain confirmation waiting times. This integration will make Xapo Bank the first fully licensed private bank to offer Lightning payments.\n\nThe Lightning Network enables scalable payments at millions of transactions per second across the network, reducing the time-consuming and costly experiences often faced by users who pay for small transactions in bitcoin.\n\nSeamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, said in regards to the partnership, \"By integrating with the hyper-efficient Lightning Network, we are the first bank in the world to streamline this process and allow our members to pay for small purchases with Bitcoin without having to convert to USD first.\" Rocca added that Xapo Bank offers an annual interest rate of 4.1% on US dollars and will soon be offering up to 1% on Bitcoin, to be paid out daily.\n\n\n\n\"We're thrilled to enable the first bank on the Lightning Network to offer instant, cheap Bitcoin payments to its customers,\u201d said David Marcus, co-founder and CEO of Lightspark. \u201cXapo has been one of our early closed beta partners, and we're delighted they chose Lightspark's enterprise-grade solution to reliably send and receive payments on the Lightning Network without all the complexity and operational overhead that typically comes with running a node on it.\"\n\nXapo Bank members can pay via the Lightning Network by holding bitcoin in the Xapo Bank App and scanning and paying an invoice at any merchant that accepts Lightning payments.\n\n\n\nThe network charges a small fee for each transaction, and Xapo Bank has set a fixed payment fee for 15 sats to protect members from executing transactions with high fees.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether prices slumped in Friday morning trading in Asia, along with all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies amid reports U.S.-based cryptocurrency bank Silvergate Capital Corp. could be the next corporate victim of the FTX crash. Polkadot led the losses. U.S. equities rose Thursday after a week of fluctuations on conflicting Federal Reserve comments about interest rates and data suggesting inflation is well entrenched in the economy.\n\nSee related article: Bitcoin\u2019s price gains this year bring needed relief to cash-strapped crypto mining industry\n\nBitcoin fell 3.22% in the past 24 hours to US$22,827 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data, extending its weekly loss to 4.78%. Ether dropped 3.19% to US$1,602, for a seven-day fall of 3.33%.\n\nBoth tokens fell as much as 5% later in the Asia morning. Despite the slump, both are still up around 40% for the year to date.\n\nPolkadot led the losers among the top cryptocurrencies, sliding 6.00% to US$6.08, and losing 14.63% in the past seven days. The token has been in a downward trend for two weeks, though the Polkadot community remains active, leading the daily development on Github, according to Github tracker ProofofGithub on Thursday.\n\nSilvergate said Thursday in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the company is evaluating \u201cits ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d which sparked a more than 50% plunge in its stock price. A raft of crypto exchanges and platforms have cut ties with the bank.\n\nAs a Federal Reserve member bank, Silvergate positioned itself as a gate between traditional finance and crypto. The bank was hit hard by the FTX collapse and reported a US$1 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2022. It laid off 40% of its staff in January.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 1.02% in the past 24 hours to US$1.07 trillion. And the total trading volume over the last 24 hours went down 12.30% to US$42.65 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05%, the S&P 500 moved up 0.76% and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged higher to 0.73%.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated on Thursday that he supports an interest rate increase of 25 basis points in March, alleviating some recent concern the Fed may hike 50 points. This helped stocks move higher, but the market is caught in cross-currents as Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the same day that recent data suggests the inflation fight is far from over.\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Labour on Thursday showed initial jobless claims fell in the week ending Feb. 25, while labor costs rose, indicating inflation hasn\u2019t been tamed by the Fed\u2019s interest rate hikes so far.\n\nThe Fed set U.S. interest rates between 4.5% to 4.75% in February, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 72.3% chance that the Fed will raise rates by another 25 basis points this month. They also predict a 27.7% chance for a raise of 50 basis points, a decrease from 29.9% on Thursday."

        "content": "Company mines 576 bitcoin in the year\u2019s shortest month; hits new efficiency milestone of 30.6 watts per terahash\n\nLAS VEGAS, March 02, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CleanSpark, Inc. (Nasdaq: CLSK), America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122, today released its unaudited bitcoin mining and operations update for the month ending February 28, 2023.\n\n\u201cOur background in energy efficiency gives us a clear advantage in the market as we make incremental improvements to our mining fleet,\u201d said Zach Bradford, CEO. \u201cFor example, this month we improved our efficiency by over three percent compared to December 2022, when we last reported these numbers in our quarterly report. That progress, coupled with average wholesale power rates as low as two cents per kilowatt hour, has allowed us to increase our profit margins even as production compressed month-over-month due to February being the shortest month of the year. Months like February are practice-runs for halving\u2014and we intend to continue to test and deploy all hardware and software at our disposal in our bid to be the best prepared miner when halving happens next year.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, construction continues in Washington, where an additional 50 megawatts are set to go online in a few months. We are relying on everything we have learned in this space, since constructing our very first mining campus in College Park, as we build the Washington expansion. Our ability to constantly iterate\u2014whether we are building air-cooled facilities or deploying latest-gen immersion cooling\u2014is built into the CleanSpark way. It\u2019s how we have managed to grow fast and reliably in the few short years since we entered this industry\u2014and how we\u2019ll continue to grow well into our future.\u201d\n\nFebruary Bitcoin Mining Update (unaudited)\n\nBitcoin mined in February: 576\n\nCY2023 bitcoin mined: 1,273\n\nTotal BTC holdings as of February 28: 100\n\nTotal BTC converted for operations and growth in February: 778\n\nCurrently deployed fleet of about 66,900 latest-generation bitcoin miners with a hashrate of 6.6 EH/s\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Company funded growth and operations through the sale of 778 bitcoins in February 2023 at an average of approximately $23K per BTC (compared to $19K in January 2023). Sales of BTC equated to proceeds of approximately $17.9 million. February daily BTC mined averaged about 20.6 and reached a high of 21.5.\n\nAbout CleanSpark\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK) is America\u2019s Bitcoin Miner\u2122. Since 2014, we\u2019ve helped people achieve energy independence for their homes and businesses. In 2020, we began applying that expertise to develop sustainable infrastructure for Bitcoin, an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion. We strive to leave the planet better than we found it by sourcing and investing in low-carbon energy, like wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro. We cultivate trust and transparency among our employees, the communities we operate in, and the people around the world who depend on Bitcoin.
