        "content": "Marco Bello | Reuters\n\nThe price of bitcoin has surged in 2023 as investors await approval for the first U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, which would be a milestone for cryptocurrency investors, experts say. In early December, the digital currency topped $44,000 for the first time since April 2022, and year-to-date gains were above 160%, as of Dec. 21, mostly fueled by optimism for a spot bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, discussions between the Securities and Exchange Commission and asset managers hoping to list bitcoin ETFs have advanced to technical details, signaling to some experts that an approval could be imminent. More than a dozen firms \u2014 including BlackRock , WisdomTree, Valkyrie and others \u2014 are waiting for the green light from the SEC, which could come in early January.\n\n\"For ETF investors, this would be the best product on the market,\" said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. \"All the other options right now have flaws to varying degrees.\" Currently, U.S. investors can buy bitcoin futures ETFs, which own bitcoin futures contracts, or agreements to buy or sell the asset later for an agreed-upon price. The long-awaited bitcoin spot ETF would invest in the digital asset directly.\n\nLoading chart...\n\nIf the SEC signs off on a spot bitcoin ETF, Armour anticipates a \"batch approval,\" with multiple ETF listings on the same day. \"I would expect them to rule on spot ETFs holistically because most issuers are taking similar approaches\" with applications, he said. \"There are a lot of good signs that the SEC is taking the most recent batch of filings more seriously,\" Armour said. \"I'm more optimistic about a bitcoin ETF than ever before.\" Some crypto investors expect a bitcoin rally upon approval, but it's also possible the price will dip as investors sell to collect profits, Armour said.\n\nCryptocurrency remains an 'extremely volatile' asset\n\nWhile SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF may make the asset class more accessible to the masses, experts urge investors to consider their risk tolerance and goals before piling in. \"I think it depends on the investor,\" said certified financial planner Ben Smith, founder of Cove Financial Planning in Milwaukee. If you're a more aggressive investor with an appetite for higher risk, a spot bitcoin ETF could fit into a diversified portfolio, he said.\n\nwatch now"

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter China banned all crypto transactions and mining in September 2021, bitcoin-mining companies increasingly turned to places like rural parts of Nebraska, Wyoming, and especially Texas.\n\nRecent reporting by The New York Times suggests these crypto mines are leading to some worrying socioeconomic implications.\n\nA bitcoin mine in the 281-person town of Channing, Texas, is facing a lawsuit over accusations it did not pay workers in full. BitRush, also known as BytesRush, is owned by Jerry Yu, a 23-year-old New York University student who's a Chinese citizen and a US resident.\n\nCrypton Mining Solutions, another Texas-based crypto-mining company, is also suing BitRush, claiming the company failed to pay for services rendered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lawsuits have unearthed documents showing that Chinese investors have flocked to the US, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build and run crypto mines, the Times reported.\n\nThanks to its cheap energy and crypto-friendly legislation, Texas has become a hub for cryptocurrency-mining facilities: large warehouses full of computers \"mining\" digital currency like bitcoin around the clock.\n\nChinese investors who set up operations in the US can use these mines to generate crypto and then exchange it for dollars online.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe mines and equipment are often purchased using cryptocurrency, making the origins of these funds impossible to trace, according to the Times. That lack of visibility allows investors to bypass oversight by US regulators and restrictions on money leaving China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the lawsuit, Crypton Mining Solutions accused BitRush investors of being \"not only Chinese citizens, but citizens in highly political and influential business positions,\" the Times reported.\n\nYu's lawyer, Gavin Clarkson, told the Times via email that the claims against Yu were \"baseless.\"\n\nHowever, further investigation by the newspaper showed that individuals who signed the mortgage on Yu's Manhattan apartment matched the names of a married couple who own shares in Chinese companies worth more than $100 million.\n\nDocuments procured by the Times suggest that the pair, Yu Hao and Sun Xiaoying, potentially Yu's parents, could also be investors in and directors at BitRush.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYu's lawyer would not confirm to the Times Yu's relationship with the individuals or the identities of shareholders.\n\nThis is not the first time a crypto-mining company has come under scrutiny for its connection to China and potential security risks.\n\nPentagon officials began monitoring a bitcoin operation in Wyoming in October. The mine's owners' ties to China pose a national security threat, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe mine is located across from a Microsoft data center and a nearby military base.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn September 2022, the White House released a statement saying the US now had the largest bitcoin-mining industry in the world and was responsible for 38% of global bitcoin activity, a 34.5% increase from 2020."

Dinara Co-Founder & CEO Laurence Latimer joins Yahoo Finance to discuss what would happen both immediately, and down the line, if the ETF is approved and how other cryptocurrencies can benefit from it.\n\nLatimer believes \"it would be a massive event for the industry\" and that it would be a \"great support for the institutionalization of digital assets and the mainstreaming of digital assets, widespread adoption.\" However, he also believes that \"much of the price movement has largely been priced in\" and that there is some \"frothiness\" in bitcoin prices.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJARED BLIKRE: As the markets price in rate cuts into the new year, those in crypto are betting big money on a spot Bitcoin ETF and it becoming a reality as the SEC gives companies a new deadline of December 29 to make final changes to their applications. The new deadline has led many industry watchers to predict a wave of approvals come January, but not necessarily news there. Bitcoin is now trading above $42,000, reaching levels this month we haven't seen since April of 2022.\n\nAnd for his take on what is coming next for crypto, let's bring in Laurence Latimer, the co-founder and CEO of Dinara, a crypto-trading platform. Laurence, thank you for coming in here today. So what is the importance of this spot Bitcoin ETF? I've been tracking this for months. I've been seeing the enthusiasm. But I guess the big question is when we get this finally maybe on January 10, is it a sell-the-news event?\n\nLAURENCE LATIMER: Yeah, and I thank you for having me. First of all, as we come down to thinking about what's happening for the Bitcoin approvals-- Bitcoin ETF approvals, the reality is much of the enthusiasm, as you just said, much of the attention has-- and much of the price movement has largely been priced in. That's what we think here at Dinara, and that's certainly what we believe.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's going to be a massive event for the industry. The work that's gone into that from some of the largest firms in the industry has been happening over two-- some of them over two years. So it is a really massive event. It's a great sort of support for the institutionalization of digital assets and the mainstreaming of digital assets, widespread adoption. But we do think there's maybe a little bit of frothiness there and that the kind of price movement that many are expecting to see may already be mostly priced in.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, do you think about the perhaps tail, the longer tail of it? We'll see a jump, perhaps, early on in inflows into some of these ETFs, but then what after that? What is perhaps a good baseline for us to consider looking at the amount of flows that actually make their way into one of the riskier parts of the asset classes out there?\n\nLAURENCE LATIMER: Yeah, well, you know, we made some predictions for 2024, and so this sort of falls firmly in the space there. We think that there's going to be some real meaningful appreciation across the whole industry. In October, the overall market cap for digital assets sat at around $1 trillion. It's now about $1.6 trillion. We think by the end of 2025, you'll be sitting at about $2.5 trillion in overall market cap. So if you kind of averaged that across the industry, we think there's another 50% or so upside built into the, you know, pricing of all assets. We think Bitcoin's among them.\n\nWhat we'll see is that ETF demand that's created there will put a nice floor and support for price movement. We also think there's some optimism around the legislative front. We hope to see some thoughtful legislative action at some point in 2024 as well. That will, again, put some upward pressure.\n\nAnd then you have Bitcoin halving, which is a technical piece that's happening, I believe, in April. And that traditionally has also put some upward pressure on the price of the asset."

        "title": "MicroStrategy's bitcoin bet produces over 300% gain for investors in 2023 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article MSTR Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor speaks at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, a crypto-currency conference held at the Mana Convention Center in Wynwood on June 04, 2021 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty Images\n\nMicroStrategy was founded almost 35 years ago and existed for most of its history as a little-known software company focused on business intelligence. But in 2023, the stock has soared 337%, making it one of the biggest gainers in the U.S. among companies valued at $5 billion or more, topping Nvidia's 234% rally and Meta's 194% surge. Unlike its tech peers, which rely on revenue growth and market share gains to fuel their stock prices, MicroStrategy's investor appeal is almost exclusively due to bitcoin . The company began buying the cryptocurrency in mid-2020 and has since amassed roughly 174,530 bitcoins, worth about $7.65 billion as of late Friday. Wall Street is so enamored by the story that the stock has about doubled bitcoin's gain this year. \"It's really bitcoin,\" said Joseph Vafi, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity who has a buy recommendation on the stock. \"All the other stuff is healthy and doing a good job, they're not neglecting it. It's doing well, it's leading software in its sector. But it's basically something we don't have to worry about.\" MicroStrategy's market cap is $8.5 billion, meaning 90% of its valued is tied directly to its bitcoin holdings. When bitcoin plummets or soars, so does MicroStrategy. In 2022, bitcoin's 64% drop pushed MicroStrategy down 74%. Even after its huge pop this year, MicroStrategy shares are still below where they were trading at their high in 2021, during peak crypto. The bitcoin strategy dates back to July 2020, when the company said it would start putting some of its cash towards alternative assets, including digital currencies. At the time, MicroStrategy had a market cap of roughly $1.1 billion, built on a software business that had been shrinking since 2015. Annual revenue was just under $500 million, and profit was minimal.\n\nAt the halfway point of 2020, MicroStrategy had just over $530 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. Co-founder Michael Saylor, who was CEO at the time, saw that money sitting virtually idle on the sidelines due to low interest rates and wanted to put it to work. From there, he had to decide whether equities, precious metals or bitcoin would be the best use of funds. \"The reason we decided to buy bitcoin is because bitcoin represents a form of digital gold,\" Saylor said on the first earnings call after the company announced its strategy. \"It's harder than gold. It's smarter, it's stronger, it's faster than gold.\" Saylor's decision created a way for investors to have stake in bitcoin through routine purchases of stock, rather than having to buy the coins directly. Saylor, who stepped down as CEO last year and assumed the role of executive chairman, told CNBC's Morgan Brennan last week that he expects the bull market in bitcoin to continue next year. He said 99.9% of the capital in the world is invested in real estate, stocks, bonds and commodities, with only 0.1% allocated toward bitcoin. \"People, as they get educated on digital assets, are realizing that they ought to be allocating more and more of their capital to this digital asset and so they're moving from .1 to .2%,\" said Saylor, who co-authored a book about bitcoin last year titled \"What is Money?\"\n\nwatch now\n\nNovel use of cash\n\nMicroStrategy isn't the first company to put some of its cash pile into alternative investments, and it's not the last to look for ways to generate outsized returns on that money. Earlier this month, GameStop gave CEO Ryan Cohen, who gained minor celebrity status as an investor, permission to use company cash to purchase stock. But MicroStrategy is unique in that it's become viewed almost exclusively as a bitcoin holding company. \"Michael Saylor's kind of a visionary,\" said Vafi. \"He saw this as an opportunity to really exploit the fact that they had a lot of cash and a pristine balance sheet and start this bitcoin treasury experiment. And it's worked out well and so they're continuing down that path.\" In analyzing why MicroStrategy's stock has so dramatically outperformed bitcoin this year, Vafi described it as a \"scarcity premium,\" because there are limited ways for equity investors to tap the market. That's potentially changing in the new year, as investors gear up for a flurry of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, there are bitcoin futures ETFs, which are comprised of contracts to buy and sell bitcoin but not of the cryptocurrency itself. And investors can buy into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust , a fund that owns bitcoin and trades over the counter rather than on a major exchange. Grayscale sued the SEC last year after the regulator denied its application to create a spot bitcoin ETF on concerns about investor protections. In August of this year, an appeals court ruled in favor of Grayscale, a decision than many in the industry viewed as paving the way for a new crop of ETFs. Asset managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity and Invesco, have filed with the SEC for their own products. Vafi said the prospect of competition poses little threat to MicroStrategy. \"I call it right now a very high-class problem to a certain degree,\" he said. \"If a bitcoin ETF gets approved, the price of bitcoin is probably headed higher and potentially materially higher.\" MicroStrategy also presents more than just a bet on the direction of bitcoin. While ETFs are passively managed, MicroStrategy has the option to put its bitcoin holdings to work, using them, for example, as collateral to create more business opportunities. \"MicroStrategy is encouraged by the continuing maturity of the regulatory environment around bitcoin as well as the increased institutional demand that we are seeing today,\" Shirish Jajodia, the company's vice president of treasury and investor relations, told CNBC in an email. \"We do believe it will have a positive impact on the adoption of bitcoin by mainstream investors as well as corporations.\" MicroStrategy's software business is a big plus too, Saylor said on the company's most recent earnings call. It's a proven cash flow generator, enabling the company to buy more bitcoin, he said. For the many investors betting against MicroStrategy, it's been a tough year. As of early December, crypto stock short sellers were down $6.1 billion for the year, with the rally in Coinbase hurting them the most, according to S3 Partners. In the first three quarters of the year, short sellers spent $2.19 billion covering their bets, the firm said, with the majority of the buying in Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Short sellers this year have lost $4 billion on Coinbase and $1.4 billion on MicroStrategy, according to data provided by S3 last week. Some 23% of MicroStrategy's shares available to the public are shorted, S3 said, which is second highest among crypto companies, behind only bitcoin miner Marathon Digital . The average for U.S. stocks is 5%. MicroStrategy shows no signs of slowing down when it comes to snapping pu bitcoin. The company said it purchased roughly 16,130 bitcoins in November for over $593 million, even with the price continuing to rise. That's more bitcoin than it's bought in any full quarter since the first three months of 2021. \u2014 CNBC's Kate Dore contributed to this report WATCH: Bitcoin bounces back above $43,000"
