        "content": "Bitcoin could soar above $120,000 if miners keep holding onto tokens, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said.\n\nIn an interview with Insider, he acknowledged bitcoin's price gains help fuel a positive-feedback loop.\n\n\"And so your point about this becoming self-fulfilling, I suspect is actually a very important driver.\"\n\nNEW LOOK Sign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

You can opt-out at any time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin miners are creating a virtuous circle that could propel the token's price beyond already-bullish forecasts, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick told Insider.\n\nThat's as miners often sell fewer tokens when the price climbs, a bullish tendency that led him say earlier this month that $120,000 is possible next year, representing 300% upside from current levels.\n\nIn a follow-up interview, Insider asked Kendrick: if higher prices cause miners to sell fewer tokens, further boosting prices, then would even higher prices fuel a positive-feedback loop that takes bitcoin past $120,000?\n\nYes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"And so your point about this becoming self-fulfilling, I suspect is actually a very important driver,\" he said.\n\nMiners predominantly sell bitcoin to cover costs. But as the price rises and previous debt struggles in the industry ebb away, miners are letting go of less bitcoin.\n\nAnother tailwind is the coin's upcoming halving in 2024, which is when the reward given to miners is cut in half. This is to cap the supply of bitcoins, and has historically led to price increases.\n\n\"Then if you add in some of the other things, like getting close to the halving cycle, et cetera, then that sort of adds,\" Kendrick said. \"And then yeah, the cycle in theory just keeps going.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiners also have little reason outside of bitcoin's price moves to sell the token, he said. Some of this is on account of the culture surrounding the industry, with many miners holding on in the anticipation that bitcoin eventually reaches stellar highs.\n\n\"So they basically want to have a company that starts out when prices are cheap, get cheaper electricity and stuff, and then hold on. It's like a super-leveraged play,\" he said.\n\nKendrick has been bullish on bitcoin this year, and in April he said it would hit $100,000 in 2024, citing a number of other factors beyond miner profitability. Examples included bitcoin's safe-haven reputation, regulatory adaptations, institutional interest, alternative currency fall-off, and less volatility.\n\nNow, he told Insider that a few of these factors also suggest more upside.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor instance, BlackRock's interest in creating a bitcoin spot ETF signals growing demand from the investment firm's clients, while the Federal Reserve's expected end on its rate-hiking cycle would marginally help bitcoin.\n\nThe one factor that Kendrick would reassess was his idea that bitcoin would gain from disinvestment in other crypto, or so-called altcoins.\n\nFor this, he noted the recent courtroom victory of Ripple over the Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the firm in 2020 over its cryptocurrency XRP.\n\nHowever, a judge recently ruled in favor of Ripple, saying XRP is not a security, meaning it's outside the SEC's regulatory reach. The news sparked a rally in altcoins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So the assumption is, well, if Ripple is not [a security], then these are also not,\" he said. \"So that's why you had big bounces in like Solana, as an example.\"\n\nHow long this tailwind for altcoins will last is uncertain, Kendrick said, adding that any institutional success in establishing bitcoin ETFs would prompt a renewed focus on apex tokens."

        "title": "Bitcoin's dull price action ignites buying interest in LINK, FIL, SNX and THETA - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to rise above the overhead resistance at $31,000, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dive below the $29,500 support. This suggests that a catalyst may be needed for the price to break out from its range.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting son July 25 and 26 are important events to keep an eye on. The FedWatch Tool shows a 99.2% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike in the meeting. If that happens, the markets may not witness a knee-jerk reaction as the hike seems to have been priced in. However, any surprise move by the Fed could thrust the price out of the range.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nSeveral analysts expect the range to break soon, but there is no consensus on the direction of the breakout. If the price breaks below the range, analysts expect a significant downside. Some are even projecting a fall closer to $20,000.\n\nIf Bitcoin moves higher, select altcoins could attract buyers. Let\u2019s study the charts of top-five cryptocurrencies that could turn positive over the next few days.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin remains pinned below the 20-day exponential moving average ($30,036) for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bears have not been able to sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($28,979).\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThis suggests that the bulls have not given up and they are buying on every minor dip. The repeated failure of the bears to pull the BTC/USDT pair lower may attract buyers.\n\nIf the price breaks above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally toward the overhead resistance of $31,000. A charge above the $31,000-to-$32,400 zone could clear the path for a possible rally to $40,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if the price turns down and dives below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that bears are making a comeback. The pair may then slump toward the support at $24,800.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages on the four-hour chart are flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) has risen to the midpoint, indicating that the range-bound action may continue for some more time.\n\nIf bulls push the price above the 50-day SMA, the pair could attempt a rally to $30,500 and then to $31,000. The important support to watch on the downside is $29,500. If this level crumbles, the pair may decline to $27,500.\n\nChainlink price analysis\n\nChainlink (LINK) has been trading inside a large range between $5.50 and $9.50 for the past several months. The bears pulled the price below the range on June 10, but they could not build upon this advantage.\n\nLINK/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bulls pushed the price back into the range on June 21 and are currently attempting to drive the LINK/USDT pair toward the overhead resistance of $9.50. Both moving averages have turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls are in control.\n\nThe bears will try to stall the up-move in the zone between $8.50 and $8.80, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair may soar to $9.50. The important support to watch on the downside is $7.50 and then the 20-day EMA ($7.05).\n\nLINK/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe correction on the four-hour chart has reached the 20-day EMA, which is an important level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the pair could surge to $8.46. A break above this level will indicate the resumption of the uptrend. The pair could then reach $8.80.\n\nThis positive view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and plummets below the 20-day EMA. That could tempt short-term bulls to book profits, pulling the price down to the 50-day SMA and, subsequently, to $6.50.\n\nFilecoin price analysis\n\nFilecoin (FIL) is trying to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a break and close above the neckline.\n\nFIL/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($4.36) has started to turn up gradually and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers thrust the price above the neckline, the FIL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to $6.50 and, eventually, to the pattern target of $7.30.\n\nOn the contrary, if the price turns down sharply from the neckline and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($4.12), it will suggest that the bulls have lost their grip. The pair may then skid to $3.50 and later to $3.29.\n\nFIL/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is sloping up on the four-hour chart and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. There is a minor resistance at $4.74, but if this level is crossed, the pair could retest the neckline.\n\nThe bears are expected to defend this level aggressively, but if bulls do not allow the price to slip below the 20-day EMA, the likelihood of a rally above the neckline increases.\n\nAlternatively, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it will suggest that the bears are selling on rallies. That may drag the pair to $4.14.\n\nRelated: Ripple effect? Stellar (XLM) is catching up to XRP price gains\n\nSynthetix price analysis\n\nSynthetix (SNX) is attempting to break out from a basing pattern, but the bulls are facing solid resistance in the zone between $3.40 and $3.56.\n\nSNX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nDuring the pullback, the bulls did not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($2.56), which is a positive sign. This suggests that dips are being bought. Buyers will again try to clear the overhead zone. If they can pull it off, the SNX/USDT pair may start a rally to the next resistance at $4.50.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to stall the relief rally in the overhead zone and yank the price below the 20-day EMA. If they do that, the pair may tumble to the 50-day SMA ($2.19).\n\nSNX/USDT four-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears have pulled the price below the 20-day EMA, but the bulls are trying to guard the 50-day SMA. This suggests that lower levels continue to attract buyers.\n\nIf bulls propel the price above $3.15, the momentum could pick up and the pair could retest the resistance at $3.30. This is an important level to watch for because if it gives way, the pair may resume the next leg of the up-move and hit $3.82.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the rally, they will have to tug the price below the moving averages. The pair could then collapse to $2.52.\n\nTheta Network price analysis\n\nThe recovery in the Theta Network (THETA) is facing selling near the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.83.\n\nTHETA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nHowever, a positive sign in favor of the bulls is that they have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA ($0.77). This indicates that the sentiment is turning positive and traders are buying on dips.\n\nA break and close above $0.83 could open the doors for a further rise to the 50% retracement level of $0.91 and, thereafter, to the 61.8% retracement level of $0.99.\n\nThis positive view will invalidate if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. The THETA/USDT pair could then descend to $0.66.\n\nTHETA/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside an ascending channel pattern. The bulls are trying to arrest the pullback at the moving averages and resume the up-move. Generally, in a channel, the price bounces off the support and reaches the resistance.\n\nIf the price sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to propel the pair above $0.85. If they succeed, the pair may climb to the resistance of the channel near $0.90.\n\nContrarily, if the price slips below the 50-day SMA, the bears will try to pull the pair to the support of the channel. A break below this level could tilt the short-term advantage in favor of the bears.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
