        "content": "Bitcoin briefly topped $30,000 for the second time this week on growing expectations that another favorable court action raises the likelihood than an exchange-traded fund holding the cryptocurrency will finally be approved.\n\nA US court in Washington is expected to issue a mandate as soon as Friday that could make effective an August opinion that went in favor of Grayscale Investments LLC, which had sued the Securities and Exchange Commission as it looked to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. It\u2019s the next step in the process after the SEC last week opted against appealing the previous ruling, which it had lost. The mandate may be given on Monday, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart said."

        "content": "Bitcoin extended its weekly gains on Friday, briefly topping $30,000 for the second time this week, as confidence a spot bitcoin ETF will soon be greenlit grew and crypto investors continued weighing uncertainty in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 2.76% on Friday at $29,538.99, according to Coin Metrics. It ended the week with a 10.4% gain, making it its best week since June 23 when it added 17%. At one point, it climbed as high as $30,193.87. Ether added 2.46% to trade at $1,606.42 on the day and was up 4% for the week \u2014 best week since Sept. 29, when it gained 4.4%. On Friday, Ether rose to a high of $1,630.03.\n\nThe gains come even as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield briefly topped 5% for the first time in 16 years. Higher yields historically have had a negative effect on bitcoin, but the crypto asset is benefiting from a key catalyst investors have been watching all year: the approval of what would be the first spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Earlier this week, JPMorgan said the Securities and Exchange Commission is likely to approve an ETF in the next few months. Mike Novogratz, whose Galaxy Digital has an ETF application with the SEC in partnership with Invesco , told CNBC he thinks it could happen as soon as the end of the year."

        "content": "Between the bond market volatility, concerns about the Federal Reserve's rate path, and worries about a recession, some are turning to bitcoin (BTC-USD). Sean Farrell, VP of Digital Asset Strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, tells Yahoo Finance Live that amid all those concerns, there are now \"very well-reputed financial professionals who don't normally wade into crypto waters saying that this digital bearer asset is a good alternative\" to things like a 30-year Treasury. It comes after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the recent rally in the digital currency reflects a \"flight to quality.\"\n\nClick here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: We had actually discussed with Michael Sonnenshein, the Grayscale CEO, about what that crypto environment could look like after it looked like there was a clear pathway forward. And he said that they're expecting, or anticipating, an environment that we have not seen before, after that legal win took place. What could that look like from your purview, and what type of inflows do you think it could trigger for Bitcoin and other crypto-related assets?\n\nSEAN FARRELL: Yeah, look, I think-- that's a great question, and a great point by Michael. So assets trade based on who is trading them, right? And so historically, we've seen Bitcoin pretty closely correlated to tech stocks at times. At times, also very correlated, like this year, with gold. And a lot of that has to do with who is trading that asset.\n\nWhen there was-- we had the post-COVID monetary stimulus. All of the employees working from home and trading meme stocks. There was a lot of borrow, a lot of credit, in the crypto ecosystem. And so, what we saw is this incredible fervor rally that was largely correlated with unprofitable tech.\n\nBut now, I think people are seeing the volatility in the sell off in the bond market. They're seeing global calamity, a reducing of trust in and between different central banks. And that's reflected in sovereign debt prices.\n\nAnd you have very well-reputed financial professionals who don't normally wade into crypto waters, saying that this digital bearer asset is a good alternative for those who don't want to assume a 30-year bond in even a developed country. So I think you're going to see a new cohort of investors really seek Bitcoin in times of both increase in global liquidity to hedge against both asset and price inflation. And we'll also see it, as Larry puts it, a flight to quality."

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly surged above $30,000 Friday after the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped legal charges against two cryptocurrency executives from Ripple Labs, another victory for the industry as it fights regulatory threats on several fronts.\n\nThe rise in bitcoin, which jumped 5% over the last day, pushed it above the $30,000 marker for the first time since August. Other digital assets also pushed higher, including the XRP (XRP-USD) token issued by Ripple. Year to date, bitcoin has rallied more than 80%.\n\nThe rally punctuated the end of a volatile week for crypto investors, who found reasons to cheer a series of legal developments, market chatter, and rumors involving the SEC, which is attempting a widespread crackdown on the crypto industry. The regulator has sued a number of big players, including Coinbase (COIN) and Binance.\n\nThe seal of the Securities and Exchange Commission at SEC headquarters in Washington. (Andrew Harnik/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe first development came last Friday when media reports suggested the SEC wouldn\u2019t appeal a court ruling that improves the chances that asset manager Grayscale Investments will be able to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund.\n\nAsset managers have for years been trying to convince the SEC to approve a spot bitcoin ETF, which would allow investors to get exposure to the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency without having to own it. The SEC had denied the various applications, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation.\n\n\"Once the SEC announced that they would not be pursuing an appeal, we saw a very compelling bid,\" Sean Farrell, a digital asset analyst with Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThen on Monday a rumor circulated that giant money manager BlackRock (BLK) had received new SEC approval for a spot bitcoin ETF, and that pushed bitcoin near $30,000. Prices pulled back when BlackRock denied it.\n\nThe SEC is still considering applications from BlackRock, Grayscale, and a number of other asset managers; investors expect the agency to rule on the applications by Jan. 10.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlackRock headquarters in Manhattan. (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx) (STRF/STAR MAX/IPx)\n\n\"The time is right for a spot bitcoin ETF,\u201d Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said on Yahoo Finance Live earlier this week. Bitwise is among the companies seeking SEC approval.\n\n\"The SEC has previously been worried about market manipulation, about a lack of maturity in the market, but the bitcoin market of today is not the bitcoin market of a few years ago.\"\n\nThe new rally in digital assets over the last 24 hours was triggered by an SEC decision on Thursday to dismiss its charges against Ripple co-founders Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, who were sued for helping Ripple sell XRP.\n\nSEC had argued that the sale of the token amounted to a violation of US law because XRP was not registered as a security with the SEC.\n\nThe US judge overseeing the case, Analisa Torres, resolved some claims against the executives and Ripple in mid-July when she ruled that XRP was not a security when it was purchased by the general public.\n\nBut she also partly ruled in the SEC\u2019s favor by stating that XRP was in fact a security when sold to institutional investors. She later rejected an attempt by the SEC to appeal her split ruling.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s claims against Garlinghouse and Larsen over the sale of XRP to those investors were still scheduled to be tried before a jury, but the SEC said Thursday it no longer wanted to pursue those charges.\n\nThe SEC asked the court to give the agency three weeks to confer with Ripple in the hope of establishing a financial settlement tied to its sale of XRP to institutional investors. The SEC declined comment.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking and crypto.\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
