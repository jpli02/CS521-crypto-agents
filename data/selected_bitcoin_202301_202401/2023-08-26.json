        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nIllustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\n\nThis week markets appeared grateful for the dearth of news\u2014\"no news is good news,\" as the saying goes. Most leading cryptocurrencies recovered their losses over the week after last Thursday's flash crash sank virtually all leading cryptocurrencies by double-digit percentages.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) currently holds the fort at $26,015, about 0.4% cheaper than it was this time last week. A lot of Bitcoin mining machinery came online this week, as evinced by the fact that the network on Wednesday hit a new all-time high for mining difficulty alongside a corresponding spike in hash rate, or computational power.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEthereum (ETH), the second biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, matched Bitcoin\u2019s pace. At its current price of $1,647, it is down 1.6% from last week.\n\nBroadly speaking, most top thirty cryptocurrencies retained their value. The only notable depreciation over the last seven days fell upon holders of Uniswap (UNI) and Avalanche (AVAX). AVAX fell 7.2% to $10.02, while UNI crashed 7.9% to $4.58.\n\nMeme coin PEPE is still in freefall. On Monday it posted intraweek losses of over 20% as it slid from 71st to 84th place. It now enters the weekend at $0.000000865154\u2014the 98th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap\u2014or about 23.3% lower than it was a week ago.\n\nAdding to its generally poor performance, the PepeCoin team\u2019s multi-sig Ethereum address transferred 16.045 trillion PEPE\u2014worth $16.85 million at the time\u2014to four exchanges: Binance, OKX, KuCoin, and Bybit, on Thursday.\n\nThe lack of communication from the team about these transfers contributed to some heated panic selling.\n\nCapital cities were silent about crypto this week. There were only a few stories of any note.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn the news...\n\nThe Kenyan government on Monday established a committee to inquire into OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s crypto project Worldcoin\u2014a controversial project which offers people around the world free crypto if they visit their nearest \u201cOrb\u201d and supply it with biometric data (a snapshot of their eyeballs). Kenya\u2019s move came three weeks after the country suspended Worldcoin\u2019s activities within its borders.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm and charged him with crimes related to money laundering. Co-founder Roman Semenov, who was also named in the indictment, remains at large in Dubai.\n\nLast year, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) banned Americans from using privacy mixer Tornado Cash, claiming that criminals had used it to launder money\u2014specifically naming the North Korean state-sponsored hacker organization Lazarus Group.\n\nEarlier this week, the legislative body of the Central African Republic (CAR) granted approval for the tokenization of land and natural resources to help the government position the country as an up-and-coming business destination in Africa.\n\nThe project launched last year with resource tokenization in mind; it is meant to facilitate investment in CAR through Sango Coin, a state-issued token\u2014though not a Central Bank Digital Currency\u2014backed by Bitcoin on a sidechain network. However, initial responses to Sango Coin\u2019s launch were lukewarm."

        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nAmid a protracted bear market, a new conceptual framework for understanding the Bitcoin economy was launched Thursday.\n\nDavid Puell, research associate for ARK Invest, and James Check, lead analyst for Glassnode, co-authored a whitepaper dubbed \u201cCointime Economics: A New Framework For Bitcoin On-chain Analysis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt provides a toolkit to properly understand the economic realities of Bitcoin,\u201d Check told Decrypt, detailing that it \u201cadds a new lens to assess the market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe whitepaper provides insight into the differences between the current unspent transaction (UTXO) a new \"cointime \" model for understanding what the authors call the \u201creal economic weight of a Bitcoin.\"\n\n\n\nCointime economics approaches Bitcoin from a time-based perspective, proposing that the importance of Bitcoin is based on the last time a coin moved. The model introduces a new concept called a \"coinblock,\" which essentially multiplies the number of Bitcoin and the number of blocks produced while the Bitcoin remains unmoved.\n\nFor example, 10 coins held during the time necessary to produce 10 blocks represents 100 coinblocks.\n\n\u201cHeavy coinblock destruction suggests that long-term holders are selling,\" the report explains. Bitcoin\u2019s \u201csmart money,\u201d in other words, and they \u201ctypically hold larger bitcoin balances and trade from lower cost bases, generating higher profits.\"\n\nAccording to the document, two new metrics can also be used to analyze Bitcoin\u2019s economic state.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"Liveliness\" refers to how active or alive the network is, or how often coins have been \u201cdestroyed\u201d or moved. \"Vaultedness\" measures coins that are stored, alluding to how \u201cinactive\u201d the protocol is.\n\n\u201cWe believe the Cointime framework provides a highly consistent, mathematical framework measuring the economic importance of each bitcoin through time,\u201d the report read.\n\nFor Check, unlike the traditional UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) analysis\u2014which he says is \u201cvery granular and requires bespoke data engineering\u201d\u2014Cointime offers a \u201cmacro view.\u201d\n\nHe explained to Decrypt that \u201cit is simple to calculate and easy to replicate without proprietary data science.\u201d\n\nJames Check, co-author and Glassnode\u2019s lead analyst, told Decrypt that under this framing, \u201cthe bear market is much worse than expected.\u201d\n\nIn the Cointime\u2019s model, \u201csince lost coins were largely in the early years, they hold tremendous unrealized profits (over $35 billion),\u201d said Check. \u201cHowever, when we use 'cost basis' models like realized price, the losses held by active investors are masked by the profits held by lost coins.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder this framework, the true cost basis of the market is actually at around $32,000, which we are still underneath,\u201d Check added.\n\nPuell and Check highlight several value propositions of cointime economics, including reassessing Bitcoin\u2019s inflation rate and the network\u2019s valuation. Check suggested that cointime economics has two possible areas of use.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOn-chain analysts who are deep in the field and will use it to inspire new ideas,\u201d he said, and \u201cinstitutional investors looking for simpler models with higher signal.\u201d\n\nThe co-authors concluded that \u201cat the core, we have a simple mathematics toolkit to achieve vastly superior economic and valuation models which account for both the supply and demand side of the market.\u201d"
