        "content": "Bitcoin paused a retreat that began after US exchange-traded funds for the largest digital asset began trading on Jan. 11 and now faces a pivotal test if key charts are right.\n\nThe token rose as much as 3.4% on Wednesday before paring some of the gain to trade at $40,180 as of 6:55 a.m. in New York. It\u2019s down almost 20% from an intraday peak of $49,021 when the ETFs went live, as fanfare about the products gives way to uncertainty over the eventual scale of demand for them."

Liquidity is especially important in a relatively new market such as crypto, where a single large trade can have an outsized impact on an asset price, raising the risk of manipulation."

        "title": "GBTC Sheds Assets as Rival Bitcoin ETFs Add Investors - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "ETF Investing Tools\n\nThis week has continued the dueling spot bitcoin ETF narratives of Grayscale GBTC shedding assets at a fast clip but inflows to nine other products rising.\n\nTuesday outflows of $515 million brought this week\u2019s total to over $1.15 billion. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) has lost nearly $4 billion in assets in the eight trading days since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the new products. Its rivals gained $409 million in assets on Tuesday to raise their weekly inflows to $963 million. They have received nearly $5 billion in inflows since their Jan. 11 unveilings. Wednesday totals were unavailable at the time of publication.\n\nStill, Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas struck an optimistic tone about what he has called \u201cThe Great GBTC Gouge,\u201d in a post on X/Twitter.\n\n\u201cTotal rolling net flows down to +$983m as Nine loses a bit of ground despite $GBTC flows being slightly less bad,\u201d Balchunas wrote, noting that BlackRock\u2019s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) inflows continued at a $1 billion per week pace that only Vanguard\u2019s VOO could match.\n\nHe added that both were a \u201cnear lock\u201d to reach $2 billion in inflows by the week\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cAlso this shows volume and discount (which were really low for GBTC yest) may emerge as best predictors of the flow coming later (vs the transfer number ppl report each morning),\u201d Balchunas wrote.\n\nThe opposing trends have formed quickly since the SEC reversed a decade of objections on Jan. 10 to give a thumbs-up to 11 products based primarily on the spot price of bitcoin, including a Grayscale proposal to convert its GBTC trust into an ETF. Analysts have speculated that many Grayscale customers sold their shares to take profits after investing at a low price during the extended crypto bear market, which began in late 2021, or to move into competing products that charge a lower fee.\n\nGrayscale charges 1.5%, while Bitwise, among others, has waived its fee for the first six months on the first $1 billion of assets. On Monday, GBTC had dropped more than 13% of its outstanding shares. Balchunas and fellow Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart have predicted that the company would lose around 25% of its shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin's Price Fade\n\nBitcoin\u2019s was recently trading slightly above $40,100, a roughly 1.7% gain over the past 24 hours. But the price of the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has dropped about 20% since the approvals. Bitcoin dipped below $16,500 last January before rallying with a good portion of the gains coming later in the year amid rising hopes for a spot bitcoin ETF approval.\n\n\u201cGBTC continues to bleed assets as investors swap out of the relatively expensive fund into cheaper alternatives,\u201d etf.com analyst Sumit Roy wrote. \u201cSelling by arbitrageurs, who bought the fund at a discount to its net asset value, has also likely contributed to the outflows.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBulls argue that inflows will pick up once the GBTC outflows are exhausted. A more bearish interpretation would be that most of the money flowing out of GBTC is flowing into these other spot bitcoin ETFs, so the modest $1 billion of net inflows for spot bitcoin ETFs that we\u2019ve seen so far already reflects the true demand for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nGrayscale \"Dominating Trading Volume\"\n\nIn a statement emailed to ETF.com, Grayscale\u2019s John Hoffman, Grayscale\u2019s managing director of sales & distribution, wrote that GBTC had \u201claunched as the world\u2019s largest spot Bitcoin ETF,\u201d and \u201cbeen dominating trading volume.\u201d\n\n\u201cBroadly speaking, large capital markets ETFs are used in a variety of investing strategies, and we anticipate GBTC\u2019s diverse shareholder base will continue to deploy strategies that impact inflows and outflows,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2024 etf.com.
