        "content": "Bitcoin rose in Friday morning trading in Asia to near the US$25,000 mark. Ether and the rest of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also gained as global equity markets stabilized following moves by authorities in the U.S. and Europe to backstop banks with cash after a series of failures in the industry this past week threatened to spread. BNB led the crypto winners as a U.S. court overruled government objections and approved the Binance US$1 billion deal to buy bankrupt crypto lender Voyager.\n\nSee related article: US, Germany shut ChipMixer for alleged ties to US$3 bln crypto laundering\n\nBitcoin rose 2.75% in the past 24 hours to US$24,973 at 09:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency jumped 24% over the past seven days, the largest gain among the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Some commentators argue Bitcoin acted as a safe haven for investors as bank failures shook global equity markets this week.\n\nEther edged up 1.32% to trade at US$1,668, a gain of 17% for the past seven days.\n\nBNB, the native token of the Binance crypto exchange, led the winners on Friday with a 7.56% jump to US$327.98. A U.S. court judge on Wednesday rejected the government\u2019s appeal to block a US$1 billion offer by Binance U.S. to buy the assets of the failed Voyager platform. The token added 19.51% for the seven-day-period.\n\nPolygon\u2019s Matic token climbed 2.88% to US$1.14, logging a weekly gain of 14.04%. Salesforce, one of the world\u2019s biggest enterprise software firms with a market cap of more than US$150 billion, has entered a partnership with Polygon blockchain to help its clients build non-fungible token-related (NFT) programs, according to a tweet by Polygon Labs on Thursday. Saleforce previously launched a suite of customer relationship management tools for Web3 developers.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization rose 1.91% in the past 24 hours to US$1.08 trillion. Total trading volume over the last 24 hours fell 25.30% to US$61.92 billion.\n\nU.S. equities closed higher in a relief rally on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved up 1.17%, the S&P 500 rose 1.76%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 2.48%.\n\nThe gains in equities came after Credit Suisse on Thursday said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs (US$54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank to shore up liquidity. On the U.S. side, 11 U.S. financial institutions injected US$30 billion into First Republic Bank on Thursday after the bank\u2019s share price fell sharply on fears of a bank run.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress on Thursday that the U.S. \u201cbanking system remains sound\u201d, and \u201cthe Federal Reserve is providing additional support to the banking system with a new lending facility.\u201d\n\nOn the inflation front, the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday reported a drop in unemployment benefit claims in the week ending March 11 that was more than expected, indicating a strong labor market that supports the view the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates again this month.\n\nU.S. interest rates are between 4.5% to 4.75%, the highest since October 2007. Analysts at the CME Group expect a 79.7% chance the Fed will raise rates by 25 basis points this month. The chance of no rate increase is at 20.3%, down from 45.4% on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 6% on year in February, a deceleration from 6.4% in January, but still well above the Fed\u2019s goal to keep annual inflation below 2%."

        "content": "New York, NY - (NewMediaWire) - March 16, 2023 - Decimal Digital Currency, a leading cryptocurrency mining, infrastructure, and technology company, has launched its newest Bitcoin mining operation at the expansive Wolf Hollow data center in Granbury, Texas. The massive 300-megawatt data center is owned by Generate Capital, a premier, sustainable infrastructure investment and operating platform, and managed by U.S. Bitcoin Corp., which recently announced a merger with public miner Hut 8.\n\nDespite the scarcity of crypto mining hosting capacity and rising rates across North America, Decimal has secured an agreement with Generate Capital and U.S. Bitcoin Corp to deploy a portion of its latest generation, ultra-efficient S19XP Bitcoin mining machines, which it purchased from Bitmain.\n\nWolf Hollow was purpose-built by Compute North for efficient Bitcoin mining, despite Texas' hot summer temperatures. The facility is directly connected to the power station and provides grid-balancing and demand response services to the Energy Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The data center's curtailment capabilities provide the ability to quickly respond during peak demand times which stress the grid and allow power to be allocated for mission-critical use, such as hospitals.\n\nRoshan Shah, Co-Founder and CEO of Decimal, commented: \"The Decimal team is thrilled with the launch of this new cryptocurrency mining facility at one of the cleanest and most innovative data centers in the United States. Among other business lines in crypto, Decimal is rapidly expanding its mining business and entering into new joint venture partnerships as well as actively seeking merger and acquisition opportunities. We are well poised to deploy tens of thousands of additional rigs in the near to medium term and intend to dramatically accelerate our growth. We're excited about this new partnership with Generate Capital, U.S. Bitcoin, and Hut 8 as we scale our mining platform and geodiversify our decentralized crypto mining operations.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nHenry Robinson, Co-Founder and President of Decimal, added, \"The Bitcoin price surge to nearly $70,000 attracted many amateur miners seeking easy returns, but they have since realized that mining is often a cyclical business with very complex economics. Decimal has been in the mining business for a long enough tenure that we were able to actively prepare for a bear market; our operations are underpinned by a very risk-averse strategy. Meanwhile, industry-wide failures to mitigate risk have created sound opportunities to substantially expand our business. Decimal's Wolf Hollow deployment is a significant step forward in our pipeline of new projects.\"\n\nCompute North was the developer of the Wolf Hollow facility and one of largest developers and operators of cryptocurrency focused data centers with over 700 megawatts of hosting capacity operating or under development prior to their filing. Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last September, just shortly after raising over $300 million at over a $1 billion valuation.\n\nDecimal was appointed to the Plan Oversight Committee for Compute North Holding's bankruptcy proceedings. Decimal Digital Currency's responsibilities now include authority and responsibility to oversee and review the activities of the Plan Administrator, who is administering the assets for distribution. Decimal has the authority and responsibility to oversee and review the activities of the Litigation Trustee and the authority to seek to remove the Plan Administrator for \"cause.\"\n\nFor more information about Decimal digital, visit decimalgroup.io\n\nMedia Details:\n\nHenry Robinson\n\nDecimal Digital Currency\n\nhenry@decimalgroup.io\n\ndecimalgroup.io"
