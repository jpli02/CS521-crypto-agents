        "content": "monsitj / Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nSo-called \u201cspot\u201d Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) \u2014 which are \u201cBitcoin only\u201d or \u201cpure Bitcoin\u201d funds \u2014 have been a holy grail concept for crypto aficionados for some time, but have long faced legal stalling from regulators.\n\nSee: ChatGPT Was Given $20K To Invest In Stocks and Crypto \u2014 Here\u2019s How It Made $2,000 in a Month\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nInvestors and investment managers have anxiously been awaiting approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding Bitcoin ETFs, as several companies have filed for the approval of such funds with the SEC \u2014 approvals which have either been rejected or delayed.\n\nNow, though, it appears things may begin to change.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported on Oct. 16, the SEC will not ask a federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that paves the way for Grayscale Investments to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF, according to a person familiar with the matter. Some experts are viewing this outcome as a watershed moment.\n\nIn October 2021, Grayscale announced it had filed with the SEC to convert its Bitcoin Trust into a Bitcoin Spot ETF \u201con the heels of the SEC\u2019s clearance of a Bitcoin Futures ETF,\u201d according to an announcement. The filing faced opposite from the SEC, however.\n\nIn August, in a highly anticipated decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the SEC\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThe denial of Grayscale\u2019s proposal was arbitrary and capricious because the Commission failed to explain its different treatment of similar products. We therefore grant Grayscale\u2019s petition and vacate the order,\u201d court documents read.\n\nA Grayscale spokeswoman indicated the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\u2019s 45-day period to seek rehearing has now passed.\n\n\u201cThe Court will now issue its final mandate within seven calendar days. The Grayscale team remains operationally ready to convert GBTC to an ETF upon the SEC\u2019s approval, and we look forward to sharing more information as soon as practicable,\u201d she added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso: 8 Best Cryptocurrencies To Invest In for 2023\n\nIs An Approval Likely To Arrive Soon?\n\nAccording to Thomas Hogan, former chief economist from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee and economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, although there has been no official word from the SEC, there are hints that the approval of a Bitcoin ETF is becoming more likely.\n\n\u201cMajor investment companies like BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, have joined the many firms filing applications for Bitcoin ETFs. Almost 100% of BlackRock\u2019s previous ETF filings have been approved, so they probably would not have filed an application unless they thought approval was likely,\u201d said Hogan.\n\nSeveral experts echoed the above sentiment, including Nihar Neelakanti, CEO and co-founder of Ecosapiens. Neelakanti said it seems an approval of a spot BTC ETF is actually right around the corner \u2014 and, at the latest, is poised to happen early next year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just too much political pressure placed on the SEC for it not to approve, especially when you think about what institutions are involved here, such as BlackRock and Vanguard,\u201d said Neelakanti. \u201cLegally, with courts having essentially weighed in in favor of Grayscale and its proposed ETF, it\u2019s now almost impossible to resist an approval.\u201d\n\nNeelakanti added that when an approval happens, we will see a wall of money flooding into the space.\n\n\u201cWe saw a hint of this when there was false news reported recently about an approval of the iShares BTC ETF,\u201d said Neelakanti, referring to the erroneous news published earlier this week. \u201cThe price of BTC shot up 10% in seconds when that false approval news was reported. This tells me we will see something similar, and likely far more pronounced, when an actual approval happens.\u201d\n\nWhat Would a Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval Mean for Investors?\n\nZachary Townsend, co-founder and CEO of Meanwhile, said the SEC\u2019s deadline for appealing the decision around Greyscale\u2019s ETF application passed a few days ago \u2014 that it\u2019s less a matter of if it will be approved, but rather when.\n\nAnd when a spot BTC ETF is approved, he said he expects tens of billions of dollars to flow into Bitcoin and then, indirectly, the broader digital asset ecosystem.\n\n\u201cSo many investors are keen on getting exposure to Bitcoin, but they don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of self-custody, which is difficult for even seasoned Bitcoiners,\u201d said Townsend.\n\nIn turn, he added that an approved spot BTC ETF will provide that kind of investment vehicle for investors \u2014 and that such a vehicle will also make it far easier for investment advisors to advise their clients in getting BTC exposure via one of these approved ETFs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a tremendous amount of passively invested money that is poised to go into these BTC products, which are likely going to be available for 401k-like investments and such,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue now is timing, and I think next year is likely when we will see these approvals come about. There could be more delays, of course, but next year seems likely to me.\u201d\n\nAnother impact of a potential approval is on Bitcoin\u2019s price, which, according to several experts, could shoot up once this happens.\n\nBradley Duke, chief strategy officer at ETC Group, said that Bitcoin holders are celebrating this news because they believe a spot Bitcoin ETF being approved in the U.S. will unleash pent-up demand. It is also believed that, ultimately, the ETF issuers will need to buy and hold a lot of Bitcoin to back these ETFs.\n\n\u201cWith the total supply of Bitcoin being fixed at 21 million coins, this jump in demand will undoubtedly lead to upward price pressure on the Bitcoin spot price,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how big this pent-up demand is and the timing thereof, but many institutional investors will get comfort from the fact that asset management giants like Blackrock will be issuing these new products, along with the fact that just about every major U.S. player in financial services, now has some kind of business in crypto \u2014 from Goldman Sachs to Fidelity, from Citadel to Charles Schwab and many others.\u201d\n\nCan Approval Help the Broader Crypto Space?\n\nWhile a spot Bitcoin ETF has the potential to increase Bitcoin adoption, particularly among traditional financial players and advisors, it\u2019s important to note that the ETF has certain limitations in comparison to owning actual Bitcoin. This is the position held by David Waugh, business development and communications specialist at Coinbits.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, an ETF can act as a connection for financial professionals who were previously hesitant or unprepared to enter the cryptocurrency space, which could positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, he noted that ETFs are restricted because they operate within the traditional financial system, so they do not provide complete protection against market, government, or compliance risks that holding Bitcoin in self-custody does.\n\n\u201cIn other words, Bitcoin ETFs make the asset more accessible, but they do not fully encompass the revolutionary autonomy and protection that Bitcoin represents as a decentralized asset,\u201d he added.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Cryptocurrency Is About To Go Mainstream With Latest Bitcoin ETF \u2014 Can It Make Owning Crypto More Profitable?"

        "title": "The secret life of Jimmy Zhong, who stole \u2013 and lost \u2013 more than $3 billion - CNBC",
        "content": "Athens, Georgia, is home to the University of Georgia, and the police there are used to college town-type crimes: break-ins, bar fights and assorted rowdiness. That kind of thing. But the 911 call that came in on the night of March 13, 2019, was unlike anything the Athens-Clarke County Police Department had ever encountered. On the phone was 28-year-old Jimmy Zhong, a local party boy and Georgia alum who frequented Athens' drinking establishments. He wasn't like the other town rowdies \u2013 Zhong was also a computer expert who had an unusually robust digital home surveillance system. Now, he was calling to report a crime: hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto currency that he said had been stolen from his home. Thinking of all that lost money, Zhong was distressed.\n\nIn March 2019, someone broke into Zhong's home, shattering the window. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\n\"I'm having a panic attack,\" Zhong told the dispatcher, according to a recording obtained by CNBC. Zhong turned down the dispatcher's offer of an ambulance, and began trying to explain the situation. \"I'm an investor in bitcoin , which is like an online thing,\" he said. What happened next would bring an end to a nearly decade long manhunt and solve one of the biggest crimes of the crypto era. And it also would lead to the largest seizure of cryptocurrency from an individual in the history of the Department of Justice. Zhong's emergency call that winter evening sent investigators down a long digital trail that led back to the earliest days of bitcoin and revealed a dark truth about the universe of hackers and coders responsible for the creation of cryptocurrencies. It's a world where heroes and villains traded places and could even be the same people. None of it would go at all the way Zhong wanted. The 911 call didn't produce a suspect in the theft from Zhong's house. Athens police were dealing with one of their first crypto cases and unfamiliar with the shadowy underworld, and they failed to make progress in the case. So Zhong turned to local private investigator Robin Martinelli, who owns and operates Martinelli Investigations in nearby Loganville, Georgia.\n\nRobin Martinelli, Martinelli Investigations owner and private investigator. CNBC\n\nA former sheriff's deputy turned PI, Martinelli was far from an expert in crypto. She specialized in process serving, cheating spouses and custody investigations, the type of probes that once got her firm featured on an episode of \"The Montel Williams Show.\" Martinelli had recently undergone surgery to amputate one leg, leaving her to conduct her surveillance operations with the help of a prosthetic. Still, she was motivated to solve Zhong's case. \"When you wake up and don't put two feet on the ground, but you still have to run a company, you got to get out there and kick ass,\" Martinelli told CNBC in an interview for the new documentary, \"Crypto 911: Exposing a Bitcoin Billionaire.\" She began by examining Zhong's robust surveillance video archive of his home. In looking at footage from the night of the crime, Martinelli spotted a slender male figure.\n\nSurveillance footage CNBC obtained captures someone breaking into Zhong's home in March 2019. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\n\"We could tell that they had like a hood on \u2013 a gray hood \u2013 but then they had almost like a black ski mask,\" Martinelli said. The suspect appeared to know his way around Zhong's house, which led Martinelli to believe that he was a friend or at least someone who had heard Zhong boast about his bitcoin stash. From the video, Martinelli was able to determine the suspect's height and even the size of his hands. She said she began her investigation by putting Zhong's friends under surveillance, following them to their homes and downtown bars on Broad Street and College Avenue. She put trackers on cars and scoured social media and conducted background checks. As she watched Zhong's bar friends come and go, Martinelli formed a low opinion of the group. She described them as \"very, very casual, plastic, not really caring, maybe using Jimmy a little bit.\" Martinelli said Zhong appeared resistant to her theories, especially when they began to focus on his circle of friends. Martinelli eventually settled on one suspect in particular who she believed had stolen 150 bitcoins from Jimmy. At the time, that amount of the digital currency was worth nearly $600,000. Zhong didn't want to hear it, she said. \"He would get upset when I would kind of mention somebody would had to have known where this cash was,\" Martinelli said. And she understood why Zhong was so hurt by the idea that someone close to him could have betrayed him. \"Jimmy wanted to be loved,\" she said. \"Jimmy wanted friends.\" Even as Martinelli soured on the friend group, she was warming up to her client, who she perceived as an odd man in search of friends. \"Jimmy was a good guy,\" she said. A lot of people around Athens felt similarly about him. In the years before the theft, Zhong was known for throwing a lot of money around town. He was the kind of guy who would buy a round of expensive shots for the whole bar, hundreds of dollars vanishing in seconds down eager throats.\n\nZhong pictured with two women in front of a limousine. Source: Zhong's social media profile\n\nAlthough he lived in a modest off-campus bungalow, near student housing and the downtown college bar scene, he stayed at fancy hotels, including the Ritz Carlton, the Plaza and the Waldorf Astoria, according to court documents CNBC reviewed. He shopped at high-end stores such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Jimmy Choo. He drove fancy cars, including a Tesla . He bought a second home, a lake house with a dock in Gainesville, Georgia, a short drive from Athens. He stocked it with jet skis, boats, a stripper pole, and lots and lots of liquor.\n\nZhong pictured with two women on a yacht. Source: Zhong's social media profile\n\nHis parties were epic. Zhong was living his best life with no visible source of income. As far as anyone knew, he didn't really have a job. He told his friends that he'd gotten into bitcoin early, mining thousands of coins in the earliest days of the technology. Zhong told people he dabbled in crypto as far back as 2009, the year bitcoin was invented by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto and a small crew of developers tied online to the anonymous crypto creator. Whatever Zhong was doing, he was making mountains of cash. And he was willing to splurge. In 2018, when his beloved Georgia Bulldogs football team made the Rose Bowl, Zhong rounded up a small group of friends for a pilgrimage to Los Angeles.\n\nZhong pictured with a group of friends at the 2018 Rose Bowl game. Source: Zhong's social media profile\n\n\"It really felt like with Jimmy, there were no limits,\" Stefana Masic, a Georgia alum and one of the friends on the trip, told CNBC.\n\nStefana Masic, Zhong's friend. CNBC\n\nMasic said not only did Zhong pay for all the tickets, but he also rented a private jet for the cross-country flight. And he gave each friend up to $10,000 for a Beverly Hills shopping spree on Rodeo Drive. They spent it on outfits, accessories and baubles to wear in the city. \"I had never flown private before, and I never stayed in such a nice Airbnb . It was cool because, you know, I got to experience a lot of things that I normally wouldn't.\" As he was cheering on his team in LA, Zhong couldn't have known that a small group of agents from the IRS Criminal Investigation unit, led by officials in the same city, were painstakingly trying to solve a crime that dated back years. What had captured the investigators' attention was a 2012 hack in which someone had stolen 50,000 bitcoins from a site on the dark web called Silk Road, according to court documents CNBC reviewed. That site was one of the earliest crypto marketplaces, where anonymous buyers and sellers exchanged all manner of illicit material. It was full of drugs, guns, pornography and other stuff people wanted to keep secret. Over the years, the value of the bitcoin stolen by the Silk Road hacker had soared to more than $3 billion, according to court documents. Investigators could track the location of the currency on the blockchain, which is a public ledger of all transactions. But they couldn't see the identity of the new owner of the funds. So they watched and waited for years as the hacker transferred funds from account to account, peeled some away, and pushed some of it through crypto \"mixers\" designed to obscure the source of the money. Finally, Chainalysis, a blockchain analytics company that was tracing the digital wallets containing the stolen Silk Road assets, saw the hacker made a tiny mistake. He transferred around $800 worth to a crypto exchange that followed established banking rules, including so-called know your customer processes, requiring real names and addresses of account holders. The account was registered in Zhong's name. The transaction took place in September 2019, six months after Zhong's 911 call to the local police. That alone wasn't enough to prove Zhong was the hacker. They had to be sure. So the IRS called the Athens-Clarke County Police Department and asked for some help, according to sources at both agencies. At the time, the police investigation into Zhong's own crime report had been languishing. \"I got a call from an IRS agent,\" Lt. Jody Thompson, who leads the local property and financial crimes unit, told CNBC. \"And he said, 'can I come by and speak to you about Jimmy?' And I was like, sure, I remember this case.\"\n\nLt. Jody Thompson, Athens-Clarke County Police. CNBC\n\nAfter that, Thompson joined forces with IRS-CI special agent Trevor McAleenan and Shaun MaGruder, CEO of a cyber intelligence company called BlockTrace. MaGruder's company works with the IRS as an embedded contractor and was hired for its experience untangling complicated blockchain transactions.\n\nShaun MaGruder, BlockTrace CEO. CNBC\n\nTogether, the three investigators said they devised a plan. They would approach Zhong using a ruse, telling him they were investigating the crime that he'd called about, the one in which a thief had stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars of his bitcoin. In reality, they were investigating Zhong for a crime they believed he had committed. A crime whose proceeds were now worth billions of dollars. When the three men knocked on the door of his lake home in Gainesville, Zhong opened it enthusiastically, according to body camera footage CNBC exclusively obtained. He believed the police officer and the two specialists were there to help solve his crypto cold case. \"If you guys solve this for me, I will invite you out for a party,\" Zhong told the trio on the body camera footage. The video shows the officers pouring on the praise. They called his front door \"beautiful.\" They called his speakers \"crazy,\" and they complimented his dog, Chad. They asked for a tour of the house. Body camera footage shows the men tapping on stone floors, looking in closets and checking out wood paneling. Zhong didn't know it, but they were scouring for secret compartments. Zhong brought investigators to his basement, equipped with a full bar and a stripper pole. \"Is this your workout?\" McAleenan asked Zhong. \"Nope, that's for girls,\" Zhong replied.\n\nBody camera footage CNBC obtained shows investigators in Zhong's basement, which contains a full bar and a stripper pole. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\nThe body camera footage also shows they got a good look at Zhong's security system, asking him to explain each of its features and capabilities. Zhong is also captured showing them a metal case he said he once used to store $1 million in cash so he could impress a woman. \"Did it work?\" asked Lt. Thompson. \"Nope,\" Zhong said. \"It never does,\" Thompson replied. The law enforcement officers learned that Zhong had a flamethrower on the premises. And they saw his AR-15 rifle hanging on the wall. MaGruder said Zhong's level of sophistication was apparent. \"He was navigating that keyboard like I've never seen someone navigate a keyboard,\" MaGruder said. \"He didn't have to use a mouse because he knew all the hotkeys.\" Playing on the ruse, the officers asked Zhong to open his laptop and explain how he came to have the bitcoin in the first place. Zhong sat on the couch next to the investigators and entered his password, asking them to turn away as he typed. When he opened the laptop, law enforcement could see his bitcoin wallet. \"Lo and behold, he had $60 or $70 million worth of bitcoins right there next to us,\" MaGruder told CNBC in an interview.\n\nBody camera footage CNBC obtained captures Zhong showing investigators millions of dollars of bitcoin on his laptop. Source: Athens-Clarke County Police\n\nThe evidence was enough to convince the investigators they were on the right track. As he exited Zhong's lake house, MaGruder told CNBC he thought to himself, \"This is incredible. I think we found our guy.\" The first visit allowed the investigators to obtain a federal search warrant for Zhong's home, McAleenan said. McAleenan, MaGruder, and Thompson returned with an enormous team of officers on Nov. 9, 2021. Before the officers raided the house, McAleenan had to explain to Zhong that he wasn't really trying to help him. He was trying to convict him. \"I said, Jimmy, you know me as 'Trevor.' I'm actually Trevor McAleenan. I'm a special agent with IRS Criminal Investigation, and we're here to execute a federal-approved warrant on your house,\" McAleenan said.\n\nTrevor McAleenan, IRS-CI Special Agent. CNBC\n\n\"And he kind of had this look like, 'Am I being punked?'\" McAleenan added. At that moment, another officer slid a device known as a \"jiggler\" into Zhong's laptop, causing the cursor to continually move and giving law enforcement access to the password-protected contents of the computer, McAleenan said. Officers flooded into the home, cracking open every crevice in search of evidence. McAleenan said in an upstairs closet, they found a popcorn tin with a computer hidden inside that held millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The popcorn tin where investigators found a single board computer hidden inside that held millions of dollars worth of bitcoin.

Court documents said the safe contained precious metals, stacks of cash and physical bitcoins minted in the early years of crypto. They also found a wallet with bitcoin from the original hack of Silk Road in 2012.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Physical bitcoin and cash investigators found during the search warrant. Source: IRS Criminal Investigations\n\nZhong was busted. \"Really late at night we were able to say we were successful,\" McAleenan said. \"We found the evidence that we were looking for. And the house lit up. I mean, every agent on the site cheered.\" As they sorted through the evidence, agents discovered something else about the unusual Mr. Zhong. He was, in crypto slang, an \"original gangster,\" or OG. Investigators discovered that as far back as 2009, the year bitcoin was invented, Zhong was among a small group of early coders who worked to develop and perfect the technology. He was a smaller contributor than some of the other OG players who have since become famous in the bitcoin community, McAleenan said. But investigators concluded that he made contributions to the original bitcoin code and offered ideas to the early developers on key topics like how to reduce blockchain size. In other words, a hacker who had been involved in the development of bitcoin itself went on to become one of the biggest bitcoin thieves of all time. \"He is one of the, as we dubbed it, the original gangsters, OGs, as far as bitcoin core software developers,\" McAleenan said. \"He had been in this space for quite a while.\" The irony of Zhong's role in the history of bitcoin is emblematic of the culture that built the cryptocurrency in the first place, said Nathaniel Popper, author of \"Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\"\n\nNathaniel Popper, author of \"Digital Gold: Bitcoin and the Inside Story of the Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money.\" CNBC\n\n\"Everybody came to this for their own reason,\" Popper told CNBC. \"And it was, as a result of that, a very sort of eclectic and eccentric group of people.\" \"Bitcoin was always shot through with irony,\" Popper said. \"Yes, there was something ironic about a bitcoin proponent stealing bitcoin from another bitcoin proponent. But I think that was also in some ways a part of what defined bitcoin.\" Zhong was charged with wire fraud. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced to one year and a day in federal prison. Zhong, now 33 years old, began his sentence at the federal prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, on July 14, 2023. In the end, Zhong didn't get to keep the stolen bitcoin. The U.S. government seized those assets. Officials opened a process that allowed victims of the hack to apply to get their bitcoin back, according to a forfeiture document CNBC reviewed. Nobody came forward to claim the loot. That's not surprising, given that users of Silk Road in 2012 were largely drug dealers and their customers. The federal government simply sold off the stolen bitcoin and will keep the proceeds. Some of the revenue generated will likely be shared with the Athens-Clarke County Police Department, in recognition of the local officers' help in the case, according to the IRS-CI. As he left the courthouse after his sentencing on April 14, CNBC attempted to question Zhong about his role in the crime. Zhong covered his head with his coat and left without saying a word. In his statement to the judge before sentencing, Zhong said having billions in stolen bitcoin made him feel important.\n\nZhong with his attorneys, Michael Bachner and John Garland, at sentencing.

CNBC\n\n\"The government has certainly not been hurt by Jimmy's conduct whatsoever,\" Bachner told CNBC. \"If Jimmy had not stolen the coins and the government had in fact seized them from [Silk Road operator Ross Ulbricht] they would have sold them two years later in 2014 as they did with other coins.\" At that point, the government \"would have gotten $320 a coin or made somewhere about $14 million,\" Bachner said. \"Now, as a result of Jimmy having them, the government has gotten a $3 billion profit.\" Zhong asked for no jail time because he was concerned about the fate of Chad, his 13-year-old dog. Zhong has had a difficult life. On the autism spectrum, Bachner said he was severely bullied at school. And he found solace over the years in an online community where he could deploy his computing skills.\n\nChad, Zhong's elderly dog. Source: Zhong's social media profile"
