        "content": "Bitcoin touched a 10-day low and smaller cryptocurrencies also declined after Binance Holdings Ltd. was sued by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission for allegedly breaking trading and derivatives rules.\n\nBinance, which exploded onto the crypto scene in 2017 and almost immediately took on and surpassed larger rivals, saw its market share surge after last November\u2019s collapse of FTX. It accounts for about 60% of crypto spot and derivatives trading volume. The company has argued that the global exchange is not subject to US jurisdiction because it has no headquarters."

Secure your seat today\n\nMicroStrategy (MSTR), a software company that was co-founded by crypto advocate Michael Saylor and that holds a large amount of bitcoin (BTC), prepaid the remaining principal on its $205 million loan from failed, crypto-focused Silvergate Bank, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.\n\nIn addition, MicroStrategy said it purchased another 6,455 bitcoins for roughly $150 million (about $23,238 per coin) over the past five weeks.\n\nThe loan payoff was made last Friday and totaled $161 million. As part of the satisfaction of the loan, 34,619 bitcoins held as collateral were returned to MicroStrategy's custody. The company took out the loan last March.\n\nThe acquisition of another 6,455 bitcoins brings MicroStrategy's holdings up to 138,955 bitcoins purchased at an average price of $29,817 each and worth roughly $3.88 billion at the current bitcoin price of $27,900.\n\nMicroStrategy also disclosed that it has raised $339.4 million this year through the sale of its shares and used the proceeds to pay back the loan from Silvergate.\n\nShares of MicroStrategy were up 0.9% premarket."

        "content": "A worsening macroeconomic climate and the collapse of industry giants such as FTX and Terra have weighed on bitcoin's price this year.\n\nCryptocurrencies dropped on Monday morning after the CFTC sued Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world, for allegedly violating trading rules.\n\nThe price of bitcoin slid 3% to $26,955.61, according to Coin Metrics. Ether fell 3.5% to $1,704.56.\n\nIn a court filing, the CFTC, or the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission, said Binance violated eight provisions of a commodities trading law \"designed to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorism financing.\" The lawsuit, which was filed Monday in a federal court in Chicago, has the potential to upend the exchange's operations.\n\nDessislava Aubert, an analyst at crypto data provider Kaiko, said although bitcoin's March rally had already started to slow in the last week, the down move Monday was largely driven by the news about Binance. It's \"the largest crypto exchange and any U.S. regulatory action against it will have huge implications for the industry,\" she said.\n\nThe CFTC court filing follows a CNBC report on Binance employees who have worked to subvert the exchange's compliance controls in China. Similarly, CFTC alleges that Binance has instructed its workers and customers to circumvent these controls.\n\n\"Many knew Binance had a bullseye on its back, but this is still unnerving some crypto traders,\" said Ed Moya, an analyst at Oanda. \"Binance's success is needed to ensure a good part of the cryptoverse can grow.\"\n\nCrypto exposed equities suffered from the news too. Coinbase and Microstrategy each fell 10%. Miners Marathon Digital, Hut 8 and Riot Platforms lost about 8% each.\n\nThe losses came in tandem with a surge in bond yields, which pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down 0.6%. Rising rates make future profits, like those promised by growth-oriented companies, less attractive."
