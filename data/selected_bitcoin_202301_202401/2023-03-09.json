Back in 2012, both California and the Midwest generated more power from wind, solar and other renewables than the Lone Star State. But in 2022, Texas was the winner. The future of the state\u2019s grid is a study in supply, demand and uncertainty."

        "content": "watch now\n\nCrypto prices fell Thursday after Silvergate, a bank that has been at the center of the industry's growth, made a decision to shut down. Bitcoin slid 7% to $20,474.50, according to Coin Metrics. Ether lost about the same amount and was last trading at $1,440.45. The slight move lower began late Wednesday, a few hours after Silvergate Capital announced it will wind down operations and liquidate its crypto-friendly bank. The relatively small size of the move indicates that cryptocurrency investors priced the news in last week when the company first warned it may not be able to continue operating and it shut down the SEN, or Silvergate Exchange Network, according to Conor Ryder, research analyst at Kaiko. The declines deepened by Thursday afternoon, however, after shares of SVB Financial, whose Silicon Valley Bank, which largely banks tech startups, announced a plan to raise more than $2 billion in capital to help offset losses on bond sales. Although SVB has said it has minimal exposure to crypto, its need to recapitalize on the heels of the Silvergate event has linked the two events in some people's minds.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin on Thursday\n\nBitcoin and ether have held up relatively well despite a challenging macroeconomic environment \u2014 still the biggest driver of crypto price action despite a declining correlation between crypto and stocks \u2014 and a series of setbacks for the space, including the recent Silvergate developments and the post-FTX regulatory crackdown on the industry that began in February. Even their single-digit drops on Thursday pale in comparison to the 60% and 41% declines suffered by SVB and Silvergate, respectively. Bitcoin's correlation with stocks is lower than it was for much of 2022 and its volatility has been near historic lows for the past few weeks.\n\nVertigo3d | iStock | Getty Images"

The airdrop is a way to reward the community for their support and participation in the development and testing of the chain. Users who participated in the airdrop process by completing various tasks before the Mainnet launch will be eligible to receive $SC tokens. Details about the Incentivized Testnet and airdrop are available on the SatoshiChain website and social media channels.\n\nSatoshiChain's commitment to creating a decentralized future is reflected in its efforts to provide a reliable and efficient blockchain platform that is accessible to everyone with the goal of multi-chain interoperability. With the initial Mainnet launch, SatoshiChain is taking a significant step towards achieving this goal.\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout SatoshiChain\n\nSatoshiChain is a blockchain platform that enables fast, secure, and low-cost transactions while supporting decentralized applications and smart contracts with bridged bitcoin as the base layer token.
