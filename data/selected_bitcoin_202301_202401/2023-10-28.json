        "title": "Bitcoin: Buy the Dip? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "In the first half of 2023, the surprising turnaround for Bitcoin (BTC -3.18%) was the talk of the crypto industry. Bitcoin skyrocketed right out of the gate, and by mid-July, had nearly doubled in price to $32,000. However, since then, Bitcoin's fortunes have cooled considerably. Bitcoin is trading around $28,000 as of this writing, a nearly 15% haircut from its intra-year high.\n\nSo is now the time to buy the dip on Bitcoin? After all, according to the Bitcoin bulls, the world's most popular cryptocurrency is simply taking a breather before once again marching higher. Are they right or wrong?\n\nChanging investor perceptions\n\nIf you are a long-term crypto investor, the good news is that the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains largely unchanged. Bitcoin adoption rates worldwide continue to grow, Bitcoin still accounts for nearly 50% of the market cap of the entire crypto industry, and Bitcoin is still the crypto of choice for institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe bad news, though, is that investor perceptions about Bitcoin have changed. For institutional investors, the macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy has been front and center, and with so much uncertainty surrounding monetary policy and the future path of interest rates, it's perhaps only natural that Bitcoin has stalled out around the $30,000 level. The conventional wisdom on Wall Street is that risk assets (such as cryptocurrencies) do not perform well in high-interest-rate environments, so the Federal Reserve has emerged as a crucial factor in how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nAt one time, Bitcoin was largely uncorrelated with broader U.S. financial markets, and investors viewed Bitcoin as providing similar hedging benefits as gold. But that viewpoint has been steadily changing. Based on changing correlations between different asset classes, it now appears that Bitcoin is trading much more like a big tech stock. The important point here is that Bitcoin's correlation with other asset classes changes over time, and that influences how investors view Bitcoin.\n\nInstitutional money and Bitcoin\n\nIf there's one factor that can decisively move Bitcoin higher in the near and medium terms, it's the flow of new institutional money into Bitcoin. At one time, institutional investors wouldn't touch Bitcoin with a 10-foot pole. But, oh, how times have changed. The first big break came in August 2022, when BlackRock entered into a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global to enable institutional access to crypto assets.\n\nSince then, the floodgates have opened. One development that has captured the attention of investors this year is the upcoming introduction of the first-ever spot Bitcoin ETF for the U.S. market. The process started this summer, when BlackRock announced plans for a spot Bitcoin ETF. After that, other high-profile institutional investors -- including Cathie Wood of Ark Invest -- jumped in with spot Bitcoin ETF applications of their own. Once one of these applications is approved, it could lead to a huge new inflow of institutional money into Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin halving\n\nIn April, Bitcoin will experience another \"halving\" event, in which the reward paid out to cryptocurrency miners for mining a new block of Bitcoin is cut by one-half. In three previous halving cycles (2012, 2016, and 2020), the price of Bitcoin has soared, and many Bitcoin analysts are expecting the same to happen in 2024. While past performance is no guarantee of future performance, it certainly hints at Bitcoin's long-term price potential.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank, for example, is predicting a price of $100,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2024. And Pantera Capital, a crypto hedge fund, has set a price target of $149,000 for Bitcoin.\n\nThe theory is that the halving, by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created in the future, will introduce a scarcity effect. As long as demand remains constant or increases, the price of Bitcoin should increase.\n\nDollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin\n\nBased on the above, I'm bullish on Bitcoin's future prospects. From my perspective, the only thing that has changed is investor perceptions about Bitcoin. As a result, now could be the perfect time to start dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin. By buying the same amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals (e.g., once per month), you would limit (but not eliminate) downside risk while also getting access to Bitcoin's enormous upside potential.\n\nIf you are expecting Bitcoin to regain its momentum heading into 2024, then dollar-cost averaging could be an effective strategy to accumulate Bitcoin."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nSam Bankman-Fried takes the stand on FTX\u2019s collapse\n\nSam \u201cSBF\u201d Bankman-Fried testified this week in his ongoing criminal trial in the Southern District of New York, denying any wrongdoing between FTX and Alameda Research while acknowledging making \u201cbig mistakes\u201d during the companies\u2019 explosive growth. Highlights of his testimony include denying directing his inner circle to make significant political donations in 2021, as well as claims that FTX\u2019s terms of use covered transactions between Alameda and the crypto exchange. Additionally, Bankman-Fried testified that he requested additional hedging strategies for Alameda in 2021 and 2022, but they were never implemented. The trial is expected to conclude within the next few days.\n\n\u2018Buy Bitcoin\u2019 search queries on Google surge 826% in the UK\n\nGoogle searches for \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d have surged worldwide amid a major crypto rally, with searches in the United Kingdom growing by more than 800% in the last week. According to research from Cryptogambling.tv, the search term \u201cbuy Bitcoin\u201d spiked a staggering 826% in the U.K. over the course of seven days. In the United States, data from Google Trends shows that searches for \u201cshould I buy Bitcoin now?\u201d increased by more than 250%, while more niche searches, including \u201ccan I buy Bitcoin on Fidelity?\u201d increased by over 3,100% in the last week. Zooming out further, the search term \u201cis it a good time to buy Bitcoin?\u201d saw a 110% gain worldwide over the last week.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals has issued a mandate following a decision requiring Grayscale Investments\u2019 application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to be reviewed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In an Oct. 23 filing, the \u201cformal mandate\u201d of the court took effect, paving the way for the SEC to review its decision on Grayscale\u2019s spot Bitcoin ETF. The mandate followed the court\u2019s initial ruling on Aug. 29 and the SEC\u2019s failure to present an appeal by Oct. 13. To date, the SEC has yet to approve a single spot crypto ETF for listing on U.S. exchanges but has given the green light to investment vehicles linked to Bitcoin and Ether futures.\n\nCoinbase disputes SEC\u2019s crypto authority in final bid to toss regulator\u2019s suit\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission overstepped its authority when it classified Coinbase-listed cryptocurrencies as securities, the exchange has argued in its final bid to dismiss a lawsuit by the securities regulator. In an Oct. 24 filing in a New York District Court, Coinbase chastised the SEC, claiming its definition for what qualifies as a security was too wide, and contested that the cryptocurrencies the exchange lists are not under the regulator\u2019s purview. The SEC sued Coinbase on June 6, claiming the exchange violated U.S. securities laws by listing several tokens it considers securities and not registering with the regulator.\n\nGemini sues Genesis over GBTC shares used as Earn collateral, now worth $1.6B\n\nCryptocurrency exchange Gemini filed a lawsuit against bankrupt crypto lender Genesis on Oct. 27. At issue is the fate of 62,086,586 shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. They were used as collateral to secure loans made by 232,000 Gemini users to Genesis through the Gemini Earn Program. That collateral is currently worth close to $1.6 billion. According to the suit, Gemini has received $284.3 million from foreclosing on the collateral for the benefit of Earn users, but Genesis has disputed the action, preventing Gemini from distributing the proceeds. Genesis filed for bankruptcy in January. It had suspended withdrawals in November 2022, which impacted the Gemini Earn program.\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $34,143, Ether (ETH) at $1,789 and XRP at $0.54.
