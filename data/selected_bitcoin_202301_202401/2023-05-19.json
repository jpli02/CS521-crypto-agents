        "content": "At Bitcoin 2023 in Miami Beach, global bitcoin payments service Strike announced that their service is now available in 65 more countries spread across six continents. This coincides with the introduction of the ability to receive funds in U.S. dollar equivalents, namely USDT. In addition, the app received a major facelift and overhaul that has made the UI cleaner, the UX friendlier and also includes a new logo.\n\nMany of the countries that have been requested by users of Bitcoin Twitter are now able to instantly send and receive money utilizing the Lightning Network. In an interview with Strike\u2019s VP of Product, Manuela Rios, she explained that the app now has an effective reach of 3 billion people.\n\n\u201cWith Send Globally, the value prop is that you send dollars and receive as a local currency directly in a bank account on the other side \u2026 this one\u2019s different \u2014 what we found through user research that people on the other side in jurisdictions with weak currencies would say \u2018Hey this experience is amazing, but can I have a dollar equivalent?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn regards to purchasing Bitcoin, Rios said that \u201cglobally, you don\u2019t see a seamless experience.\u201d So the new Strike app also functions as a Lightning wallet where you can buy and sell bitcoin via dollar equivalent rails.\n\nAt his speech at Bitcoin 2023, Strike CEO Jack Mallers explained the wider vision of the updates, saying \"We\u2019re delivering a cash balance that the global south can rely on, and an awesome beautiful punk unconventional black and white brand, as the Fed is driving our own banks insolvent.\"\n\nHe also highlighted the company\u2019s response to feedback, displaying a set of tweets asking for LNURL support, shortly after announcing that the new app has LNURL support \u2014 all usernames@strike.me function as a LNURL as of the launch.\n\n\u201cWe made a lot of product changes to support what we hope to become an amazing global money app,\u201d Mallers said. \u201cAs a company, we know what we\u2019re fighting for, we know who we are, we changed the way we looked, but we never changed the way we felt.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the new features and access, the app includes a simplified sign-up process in order to make signing up easier. \u201cThe end goal for us is to serve 7-8 billion people, and we\u2019ll be stepping our way to make it to the countries that didn\u2019t make it in this MVP,\u201d Rios explained.\n\nRios explained the impact of the launch and additional features, saying that \u201cFor the Bitcoiners, you can expect a beautiful Lightning wallet and a cost effective way to buy bitcoin, and for the people not yet so familiar with bitcoin, but are familiar with 109% inflation, giving them access to a U.S. dollar equivalent stablecoin is massive \u2014 now you can save in something that won\u2019t be so quickly devalued.\u201d\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "title": "Strike expands Bitcoin payments to 65 countries, moves global headquarters to El Salvador - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Since starting in 2019, the Bitcoin-powered payments app Strike has aimed to become a global crypto-powered equivalent to Venmo or Cash App. On Friday, the company\u2014led by 29-year-old entrepreneur Jack Mallers\u2014announced that it was expanding to a total of 65 global markets, in addition to the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, where it already operates.\n\nMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home\n\nIn an interview with Fortune in Miami, Mallers touted Strike's consumer-facing app, which offers Bitcoin and Tether transfers, through what he described as a \"frictionless onboarding.\"\n\n\"We think there are billions of people that want a money app with those characteristics and capabilities contrasted to a clouded world of crypto exchanges and hidden, unregistered licensing regimes and 1,000 different coins,\" he said.\n\nAt a time when the U.S. crypto industry is confronting regulatory uncertainty, and as the Securities and Exchange Commission is suing firms for offering unregistered securities, Mallers said this is a validation of Strike's Bitcoin-first approach.\n\n\"I think Bitcoin stands alone, and just how obvious it is that it is owned by nobody,\" Mallers told Fortune. \"Every other instrument in this industry has a founding team, a foundation, and they issued some [tokens] privately and handed them out in auctions before they went live\u2014and that sounds a lot more like a security.\"\n\nSEC Chair Gary Gensler has publicly stated that he views Bitcoin as a commodity not a security.\n\nMallers notes Strike has taken a regulation-first approach in the U.S., including in New York, where Strike is currently not available but in the process of applying for a so-called BitLicense.\n\nStory continues\n\nMallers added that Strike's expansion into other global markets came about partly as result of moving its global headquarters to El Salvador, which passed a digital assets law earlier this year establishing a regulatory framework for crypto. According to Mallers, Strike received one of the first licenses under the new regime, along with Bitfinex.\n\nMallers has ties to El Salvador and its president, Nayib Bukele, who established Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Mallers introduced Bukele at the Bitcoin Miami conference in 2021, where the president made the announcement by video.\n\nAlthough Strike was initially tapped to help develop El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment, it later retreated from the project, which suffered from early bugs and slow adoption.\n\nDespite reports that businesses and residents of El Salvador are not using Bitcoin, Mallers cited other metrics, like increased tourism. \"I do think that El Salvador found hope in Bitcoin,\" he said, arguing that merchant adoption \"wasn't what was defining success.\"\n\nThe next challenge for Strike will be to expand its ties to banking services that let customers exchange Bitcoin for fiat currency. Currently, customers in Strike's new markets will only be able to receive Bitcoin from other users, although Mallers said that he aims to launch new features, including a debit card, later this year. Another challenge comes in the form of network congestion and higher fees on Bitcoin transactions due to recent demand for new products like ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Mallers argued that \"Bitcoin is working as intended.\"\n\n\"The claims that [congestion] is hurting the third world, and it invalidates how emerging markets are using this technology is ridiculous,\" he said.\n\nMallers also pointed to another Strike feature\u2014Send Globally\u2014which allows users to transfer between USD and other currencies over Strike using Bitcoin as an intermediary, although it is limited to twelve countries in Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nCurrently, dollar balances in Strike are held in Tether, a dollar-pegged stablecoin that has drawn criticism for its shadowy accounting. Mallers said that the company decided to go with Tether, as opposed to other options like Circle and Coinbase's USD Coin, because of demand from users in the Global South.\n\n\"They don't trust Circle,\" he said. \"If I'm being totally honest, Circle is built for American institutions.\"\n\nAs advocates make the case that the Lightning network can actually transform Bitcoin into a payments service, Strike's expansion represents the first attempt to build an app that allows people across the world to transact with each other.\n\nMike Brock is the CEO of TBD, a Bitcoin-focused division of Jack Dorsey's financial technology company Block. Even as Block plots a global expansion for its payment platform Cash App, Brock was supportive of Strike's effort.\n\n\"If your mission is to advance any decentralized ecosystem, then you better hope that there's actually a pretty competitive marketplace of different companies vying for solutions within that system,\" he told Fortune.\n\nTwo years after Mallers introduced Bukele at Bitcoin Miami, he reflected on the changing circumstances, wearing a hat emblazoned with the El Salvador flag.\n\n\"Two years ago, people would have made fun of me [for our] headquarters in El Salvador to launch product for three billion people, but now Coinbase is fighting with Gary Gensler,\" he said. \"Who's laughing now?\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nMore from Fortune:\n\n5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year\u2014all while working from home\n\nLooking to make extra cash?
