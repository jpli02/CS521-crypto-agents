        "content": "Bitcoin was in sight of $38,000, a level last seen in May 2022, amid an ongoing rally spurred by expectations of fresh demand for the token from exchange-traded funds .\n\nThe largest digital asset was little changed at about $37,344 as of 6:46 a.m. Thursday in New York, and has rebound about 125% from a 2022 rout. Ether jumped as much as 2% after BlackRock filed with the SEC to list an exchange-traded fund that hold the second-largest cryptocurrency."

        "content": "Tether Expands into Bitcoin Mining With $500M Investment\n\nTether, a company specializing in stablecoins, is preparing for a significant expansion into Bitcoin mining, with a planned investment of approximately $500 million over the next six months. In an interview with Bloomberg, Paolo Ardoino, the expected CEO of Tether, shared the company's intentions to construct mining facilities and invest in other miners. The focus of this expansion will be on establishing mining sites in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador, with the goal of increasing Tether's computing power to represent 1% of the BTC mining network. These new facilities will have a capacity ranging from 40 to 70 megawatts.\n\nThis mining investment is part of Tether's recent $610 million debt financing facility, which was extended to German miner Northern Data Group. Tether has been actively increasing its loans throughout the year and had previously made a strategic investment in Northern Data Group to support initiatives related to artificial intelligence.\n\nArdoino outlined Tether's mining objectives, aiming to achieve 120 megawatts of direct mining operations by the end of this year and an impressive 450 megawatts by the end of 2025. The company is also considering the establishment of a 300-megawatt facility and plans to set up its mining infrastructure inside containers that can be relocated based on fluctuations in electricity prices. Ardoino emphasized that Tether's approach to mining is gradual, stating, \"We are not in a hurry to become the largest miner in the world.\"\n\nIn December, Paolo Ardoino will assume the role of Tether's CEO while maintaining his position as the chief technical officer of parent company Bitfinex, as previously announced in October.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "Alexis Ohanian. Pedro Fi\u00faza/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAlexis Ohanian says the crypto winter will shake out \"tourists and grifters\" from the sector.\n\nThe Reddit cofounder views bitcoin as a haven asset like gold, but for a new generation.\n\nOhanian paid just $15,000 for ether that would be worth over $100 million today if he'd kept it all.\n\nAlexis Ohanian predicts a brighter, cleaner future for cryptocurrencies, and sees bitcoin as a modern-day version of gold.\n\n\"I've invested through every 'crypto winter,' and they still don't faze me,\" the Reddit cofounder posted on X this week. \"Winter clears out the tourists and grifters, it happens in every industry.\"\n\nOhanian, the founder and general partner of venture firm 776, touted crypto as safe despite its volatility. It's \"no different than gold\" as the yellow metal's value stems from centuries of people believing it's worth something, he said.\n\n\"Bitcoin is the same thing \u2013 but for a new generation,\" he wrote, noting there's conviction in the digital token's value but unlike gold, it's completely decentralized. \"That's exciting for an investor.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin has tumbled from nearly $70,000 at its peak to below $40,000 over the past couple of years. However, it has roughly doubled since the start of this year, boosting its market capitalization to about $730 billion \u2014 not far off the $780 billion market capitalization of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nOhanian is a longstanding champion of crypto. He revealed earlier this year that he paid just $15,000 for 50,000 ether in 2014 \u2014 an amount worth over $100 million today if he'd kept it all. He made a combined $50 million from early bets on ether and Coinbase stock, he said.\n\nThe venture capitalist, who's married to tennis star Serena Williams, has predicted the crypto industry will shift from \"speculation + casino vibes\" toward wider adoption, greater utility, and fun. He's also said that bear markets are typically when people create products with real value.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This crypto winter is exactly the time when folks are gonna be building,\" he said in May. \"The next cycle won't be defined by gambling or speculation, it'll be through engaging gameplay.\"\n\nOhanian has also declared the rise of crypto and other alternative assets means the classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds will be \"dead for digital natives.\"\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "When Will We Get a Spot Bitcoin ETF? - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nHow much institutional or even retail interest is this going to bring into the crypto world? Is it going to be an important milestone? Great to be here, Matt. Thanks very much for having me. And I think you just hit that. That is the key question is is not so much the data, it's not so much when exactly the ETFs will launch, it's what will the impact be. And I think that you you really touched on it right at the top of the show with the correlation chart because that is really the key. That is the key reason for allocation to Bitcoin. I think for most investors it is that mark of vit C and free lunch that bitcoin provides because of its diversification effects, because it has over the long run been uncorrelated to most of the major asset classes. Very low correlation exhibited over the past ten years. There have been periods where that correlation has gone up, as you rightly mentioned, in that pandemic era. But this year, for most of this year, the correlation has indeed been negative if there has been any correlation at all. So that diversification re effects that that it can give in view to portfolios of stocks, bonds, cash and alternatives is what's going to drive the conversation. That's what's going to drive the inflows. The question is what is that allocation? Because because the quantitative evidence, the empirical evidence tells us it shouldn't be zero. It shouldn't be zero. But I've heard often in Conversation Suey about this idea that really at this point, you shouldn't be putting anything into crypto that you're not willing to use, and that would maybe suggest that it shouldn't be super heavily weighted in a portfolio in terms of that asset allocation break up It also, we have to keep in mind it comes against a backdrop of there being a lot of anticipation to your point about a spot ETF being approved eventually. Maybe it's a question of when, not a question of if. And I just wonder how much of that anticipation already is baked into what we're seeing in prices and if ultimately what we see is, okay, maybe a little bit more institutional attraction, a little bit more volume in terms of flows, but pricing doesn't change that much. What do you think? Yeah, that's a that's a that's a really interesting question. And I think it it you know, people have been talking about, oh, it's baked into the price that authorization approval is baked into the price. And indeed the approval may be baked into the price. But as you rightly point out, it's not so much the approval, it's how much in flow are these products, If they are approved, when they are approved, how much inflow will they see? That's you know, what is the market pricing in? Is the market pricing in the $5 billion of inflow or is it pricing in $10 billion of inflow? We don't really know. And so I think that most investors will will look at this cautiously. I don't think any institutional investors are going to be thinking about timing, the market timing of bump. What most institutional investors will be looking at is over the long term and the diversification effects that Bitcoin can have in their portfolios and add more resilience to the returns that they will see from their portfolios."
