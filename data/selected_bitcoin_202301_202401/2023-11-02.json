As major financial firms start rolling out digital-asset products for the masses, that debate is taking on new significance.\n\nDWS Group, the $900 billion German asset manager which is preparing to introduce crypto exchange-traded funds, is a case in point."

        "title": "Coinbase CFO on Trading Volume, Spot Bitcoin ETF - Bloomberg",
        "content": "00:00\n\nHow are you thinking about that going forward? Because that's been a declining trend. It has. We saw record low volatility is the lowest we've seen since we measured it in 2016. And when we see low volatility, we tend to see less active trading of our advanced trade clients, of our markets, which are our most advanced traders. I would note that these tend to be our lower revenue customers, but it's a broader trend that we're seeing. What I'm pleased to show, though, is even in these very low volatility environments with low trading volume, we generated $181 million of adjusted EBIT. We generated only a $2 million loss of net income. And so we're very proud of our financial performance. Despite the low volatility and the low trading volume that we saw this quarter for the current quarter than the quarter, that Coinbase can claim profitability with just how much you have been able to kind of keep a handle on the bottom line. I think it's really important to share the beginning of this year we said that we were wanting to build a company that could generate positive adjusted EBITDA in all market environments and we're very proud that now for those three quarters in a row, we generated more than $100 million of positive adjusted EBITDA. This is a change from when we went public when we were trying to generate profits through a cycle. And we really listen to the market and we brought down our expenses. We're proud of being a more financially disciplined company. We're offering with a lot more efficiency now and being able to deliver the financial results that we did this quarter. To the extent that the environment stays somewhat muted, do you think that Coinbase is going to have to tighten its belt further? And should you have to, where does that come from? It's a good question. Again, our goal right now is to generate positivity in all market conditions and we are pleased that we were able to do so this quarter. We also think it's important to continue investing in new technologies in the future of crypto. We have a three phase and product strategy that we are excited about, which is continuing to invest in utility, international expansion, growing new innovative products and services. We just watched derivatives this quarter, which we think is going to be an area that will continue to see investments in growth in coming quarters. And so given the financial performance, no, we're not looking to make a significant change to our expenses in Q4. And we say that in our shareholder letter about what our outlook is in the near term. However, we are always looking at the market and looking for what are the catalyst for growth, what are the risks and adjusting accordingly. Well, let's talk about one of the big potential calls in the market right now, and that is, of course, potential US spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Obviously that has ignited a rally in everything crypto. And I want to talk to you about what that could mean about Coinbase's business because a few of the more bearish analysts out there have argued that that might actually be a negative for Coinbase because it could further pull trading away from your platform. So I think what is loud and clear is that investors would like access to crypto and you see that with the excitement around these Bitcoin ETFs. So we believe this is going to be additive, this is going to be new capital that enters the market because today certain types of investors, whether that's pensions or registered investment advisors, they don't have the ability to access Bitcoin for their customers. So we believe this is going to bring new capital to the market. We will also benefit with our platform of just added interest in Bitcoin more broadly will benefit because we are going to be selected as a infrastructure provider to some of the issuers in this space where we can then custody and provide that service to the market. But overall, we think this grows, the pie grows, the interest in Bitcoin overall, and that's going to be a net benefit to the ecosystem in US. Well, just to push back, it's interesting to read this note coming from Barclays, basically asking the question is the offset that people don't need to trade Bitcoin on Coinbase because they can just buy the ETF in a typical brokerage account? I mean, is that a potential, a possibility that you're preparing for? We prepare for all sorts of possibilities, but that's not what we expect to happen. We think that there's a lot of people who are crypto enthusiasts who are looking for the underlying access to the spot asset to be able to use that in different ways. And it'll have the option of selling it, buying it, sending it, receiving it, using it in different defi applications. And so we think that there's still going to be a lot of interest in the rec spot and we think that we're going to see new market participants who want to hold this alongside other securities or other assets in an investment portfolio. Alicia, I got to ask you about the SEC's lawsuit against Coinbase. The regulators have indicated that they want to see exchanges operate separately from brokerages, custodians, that kind of thing. What kinds of discussions has Coinbase had internally about potentially splitting up the company? Is that something that you're actively planning for? So I think it's really important to note that that all comes around security tokens. And again, Coinbase would love to list security targets for today. We do not list security tokens on our platform because we haven't got to a place where we understand the market structure rules visibly how one would trade security tokens on a platform, and what those rules of market structure are to the questions that you're asking. So we like to be we'd like to be a participant in that market. We would like to be able to be a vocal contributor to how that market structure should evolve. But today that is not something that we offer. Please help me understand what's happening for assets outside of Bitcoin. We've talked before about the uncertainty that other crypto assets have relative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if you look at the transaction revenue of other crypto assets at Coinbase, it's jumped pretty meaningfully from the second quarter to the third quarter. What's contributing to that? So as we said before, there's episodic events that cause outside trading in any single asset at a point in time and we did see some certain assets that had elevated trading in Q3. These are be Q2 and prior quarters. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to be the top two assets traded on our platform. And for the first time this quarter, we did disclose that USDC exceeded 10% of trading volume. And so that was a high transaction volume on the platform during the quarter. I think it's also important to note that all of these things can evolve like different quarters. We've seen different events that cause outside trading volume and this is something that we continue to support the breadth of assets in the ecosystem, but it goes back and forth. But Ether and Bitcoin continue to be the largest contributors to trading volume. Really quickly. We have only about 30 seconds here, Alicia, but the stablecoin revenue, how consistent do you see it moving along? How consistent do we see? How consistent do you see growth yet? Stablecoins are a really important part of the overall ecosystem, and it's an area that we continue to invest in on our platform. We did see a growth in native Stablecoin assets on our platform in the quarter, so we're holding more usdc for our customers in Q3 than we did in Q2. And we've integrated into our international exchange. We're offering now rewards for people which give them the ability to earn rewards while they're are in a passive situation, while they're waiting to trade."
