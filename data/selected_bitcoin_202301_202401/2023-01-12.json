        "content": "Billionaire Mark Cuban believes an age-old market manipulation tactic could be the next thing to rock the cryptocurrency industry.\n\n\"I think the next possible implosion is the discovery and removal of wash trades on central exchanges,\" the longtime crypto investor tells TheStreet.\n\nA wash trade is when a trader buys and sells the same financial asset multiple times in order to generate fake volume and make it appear as if there is a high demand for the asset. This artificially inflated demand can mislead other traders into investing real money into the asset.\n\nSince higher demand typically leads to higher prices, traders can use this process as a type of \"pump-and-dump\" scheme: When the price is as high as the trader thinks it can go, they can cash out and leave other investors with the asset that's declining in value.\n\nAlthough wash trading has been illegal within traditional U.S. financial markets for decades, it's likely difficult to crack down on the activity within the crypto space."

        "content": "Bitcoin on Thursday surged to its highest price in more than two months, as traders bet on a U.S. inflation cooldown and digested news that lawyers for defunct crypto exchange FTX have found billions of dollars worth of assets.\n\nThe world's largest digital currency by market cap climbed above $19,000 for the first time since Nov. 8, increasing in value by 8.4%. Bitcoin last traded at $19,013.30, according to CoinMetrics.\n\nU.S. inflation data out Thursday showed a modest retreat. The consumer price index decreased 0.1% in December on a monthly basis, in line with Dow Jones estimates.\n\nPrices still increased 6.5% year-over-year, however. This was down from a 7.1% jump in November and well off a 9.1% peak rate in June. Investors hope the decline may put pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to reverse interest rate increases.\n\nThe Fed and other central banks have been raising interest rates over the past year or so in an effort to tame soaring inflation, in moves that forced stocks and cryptocurrencies sharply lower in 2022.\n\nThe hope now is that the U.S. central bank will cut rates, taking some pressure off risk assets."
