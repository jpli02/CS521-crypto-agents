        "content": "Bitcoin briefly touched the $24,000 level on Thursday, reaching a key technical level and building on its January rally.\n\nThe up move came a day after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point. But Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted that a disinflationary process has started, soothing investors who are betting on inflation to fall and causing them to take on more risk.\n\nBitcoin was last trading about 1% higher at $23,821.00, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency rose to $24,069.00 earlier in the afternoon, after rising as high as $24,249.70 Wednesday night, its highest level since Aug. 17.\n\n\"The market took the latest FOMC as dovish, but bitcoin's rally remains precarious,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank. \"The price did rise on Wednesday, but failed to close above $24k and its momentum seems to be on the decline.\""

        "content": "A New Jersey man admitted in federal court on Thursday that he had tried to hire a hit man on the dark web, paying $20,000 in Bitcoin in an effort to kill a 14-year-old who he feared would testify against him in a child pornography case, the Justice Department said.\n\nThe man, John Michael Musbach, 31, of Haddonfield, N.J., pleaded guilty to a murder-for-hire charge in U.S. District Court in Camden, N.J., admitting that he had logged on to a website that promised to kill people in exchange for payment in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.\n\nHe could face up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced on June 13.\n\nMr. Musbach\u2019s motivation for the failed murder-for-hire plan, prosecutors said, dated back to the summer of 2015, when he exchanged sexually explicit photographs with the victim, who was then 13 years old and living in New York. The photos resulted in child pornography charges against Mr. Musbach, so he decided \u201cto have the victim killed so that the victim could not testify against him in the pending criminal case,\u201d the Justice Department said in a news release.\n\nThat case concluded on Oct. 11, 2017, when Mr. Musbach pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a child by sexual contact, according to the Justice Department. He was sentenced on Feb. 9, 2018, to a two-year suspended sentence with parole supervision for life."
