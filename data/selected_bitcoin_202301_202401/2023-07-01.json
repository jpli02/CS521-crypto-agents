But that is one of the things I think we're all trying to address.\"\n\nWisdomTree's latest launch effort comes during an increased appetite for bitcoin .

I think the data sharing agreements are the key element for that.\"\n\nIt appears interest is climbing.\n\nAccording to an SEC filing this week, Fidelity Investments is also trying to launch a spot bitcoin ETF despite its prior failures.

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) gained 12% in June, but one forecast sees the good times soon fading for bulls.\n\nIn a tweet on July 1, popular trader CryptoBullet admitted that July might not offer much more BTC price upside.\n\nTrader: BTC price rally \u201clikely\u201d ending this month\n\nDespite a last-minute dive, thanks to a macro news event, Bitcoin managed to close out the month of June in a solid position.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro, TradingView and CoinGlass confirms that the monthly close came in at $30,465 on Bitstamp.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThose levels continue to hold into the weekend, with the past month marking Bitcoin\u2019s best June performance since 2019.\n\nBy historical standards, July looks even better; throughout its history, BTC price action has never lost more than 10% during the month.\n\nBTC/USD monthly returns (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass\n\nFor CryptoBullet, however, \u201ccommon sense\u201d dictates that BTC/USD should fall below some key moving averages.\n\n\u201cSo, June surprised me. We got a pretty bullish monthly close: BTC tested the the MA50, bounced strongly and managed to regain the EMA21 !\u201d he commented on the monthly chart.\n\n\u201cI can repeat what I said: $BTC can go to 35k (to hunt liquidity), but this mid term bullish rally is coming to an end. Likely this month.\u201d\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart. Source: CryptoBullet/Twitter\n\nThe concept of liquidity hunting in the low $30,000 zone remains popular as a theory for price continuation.\n\nAmong those tracking it is trading suite DecenTrader, which this week underscored the leveraged short positions stacked toward $35,000.\n\nThis ties in nicely with the massive chunk of #Bitcoin Liquidity, which is loaded all the way above $35k.\n\n\n\nIf we see cascading short liquidations, wicking all the way up to the Moonraker resistance at $37k could be reasonable. https://t.co/JR4J24Ak8H pic.twitter.com/3CEJQ9bvOI \u2014 Decentrader (@decentrader) June 28, 2023\n\nBattle of the monthly Bitcoin charts\n\nElsewhere, a broadly optimistic Rekt Capital was keen for what he called a \u201chealthy technical retest\u201d of levels below $30,000 for Bitcoin, despite the monthly close.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators send 35K BTC to exchanges in new \u2018elation inflow\u2019\n\n\u201cBTC has performed a bullish Monthly close but is primed for a healthy technical retest at ~$29250,\u201d he told Twitter followers on the day.\n\n\u201cWith price currently around $30500\u2026 I wonder what negative catalyst will soon emerge to facilitate this technical retest.\u201d\n\nFurther analysis additionally argued that even if the BTC price were to snap below that downside target, it would constitute nothing \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell positioned for upside overall,\u201d Rekt Capital added.\n\nBTC/USD annotated chart.

        "content": "TOKYO -- Bitcoin's position as the top player in the cryptocurrency market is solidifying as the prospect of an inflow of money from institutional investors has lifted the virtual asset to its highest point in a year.\n\nBitcoin touched a year-to-date high above $31,000 last Saturday, amid a surge that followed BlackRock's June 15 application to U.S. regulators for an exchange-traded fund based on the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin's share of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrency assets topped 50% for the first time in more than two years, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly rejected filings for bitcoin ETFs not based on futures contracts over the risk of manipulation in the spot bitcoin market.\n\nBlackRock aims to allay these concerns through an expected agreement with Nasdaq, where the fund would be listed, for \"surveillance-sharing\" of a bitcoin trading platform, though The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the SEC said its filing remains inadequate.\n\nIf the regulator ultimately accepts this solution, hopes are high that it will open the door to more ETFs. BlackRock's filing was followed by a string of applications from other big institutions.\n\nThis month has also seen the launch of EDX Markets, a new digital asset exchange for accredited investors backed by Fidelity, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities, that will enable trading of bitcoin and Ethereum, among other cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe platform says it will follow best practices from traditional bourses, which had been an issue with other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, which was sued by the SEC this month.\n\nThese developments have reassured some market players that problems like the collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange have not turned institutional investors away from cryptocurrency. Spot bitcoin ETFs are expected to be used by financial institutions as a way to hold the asset with no need for a wallet.\n\nInstitutional money appears to already be moving back into the market. Trading of bitcoin futures contracts has picked up on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and nearly $200 million flowed into major bitcoin investment products last week, the most since July 2022, according to data from CoinShares.\n\n\"Hedge funds specializing in cryptocurrency have recently begun to trade more aggressively with our company,\" said Midori Kanemitsu at Japanese exchange operator bitFlyer.\n\nRetail investors, meanwhile, have been less than enthusiastic this year. The number of active addresses on the bitcoin network has stayed largely flat since late 2021, and the number of new addresses being created each month is down to less than a tenth of its peak that year.\n\nDespite the growing anticipation around bitcoin, \"there's no indication that individuals are starting to trade actively,\" Kanemitsu said.\n\nThis sluggish activity is hitting smaller cryptocurrencies like Cardano and Solana, which are seeing much slower growth than bitcoin. Trading platforms popular with retail investors, such as Robinhood, are moving to end support for trading these tokens, and the risk of an SEC crackdown has made institutional investors even more leery of them."
