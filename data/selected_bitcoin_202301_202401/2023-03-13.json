        "content": "Bitcoin surged 13%, the biggest one-day increase since the wild price swings seen during November\u2019s market turmoil, and shares of crypto companies rallied following moves by US authorities to stem the spread of concern about the health of the nation\u2019s financial system.\n\nThe rally helped to extend the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s recovery from its worst week in about four months, where an equity selloff, jitters in the banking sector and an escalating US regulatory crackdown on crypto combined to hurt investor sentiment. The stablecoin USDC traded at par again with the dollar after depegging last week. Adding to the optimism was Binance\u2019s announcement that it would covert the remaining stablecoin funds from a $1 billion industry stability fund to Bitcoin, Ether and its BNB token."

Bitcoin was last higher by 5% at $22,374.68, according to Coin Metrics data. Ether rose 2% to $1,585.58. The overall cryptocurrency market gained more than $70 billion in the 24 hours to 2 a.m. ET, jumping back above $1 trillion on Monday.\n\nIt has been a rollercoaster ride for crypto markets after the collapse last week of Silvergate Capital, a major lender to the crytpo industry. Silvergate said Wednesday it is winding down operations and liquidating its bank. Then came the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday in what was the biggest banking failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Both Silvergate and SVB put their money into U.S. Treasurys which have lost value as the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interested rates. These banks have been forced to sell these bonds at a loss to shore up their capital position. That was followed on Sunday by the closure of Signature Bank , a major lender in the crypto industry, by U.S. regulators to stem any contagion to the broader banking sector.\n\nwatch now"

        "content": "The Bitcoin blockchain went live on January 3rd, 2009. At its inception, the Bitcoin network started releasing its own eponymous currency or money. Every ten minutes, the network released 50 BTC to a tiny community of cryptography enthusiasts. Although starting from humble beginnings, its creator Satoshi Nakamoto had an ambitious goal for Bitcoin to be a \u201cpeer-to-peer version of electronic cash\u201d for the world.\n\nAt first, Bitcoin didn\u2019t have a set monetary value because there wasn\u2019t a marketplace for BTC. Without goods and services being offered for Bitcoin, it was difficult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to determine its price in a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar (USD).\n\nMarket Forces Determine Prices\n\nThe cost of goods, fiat exchange rates (USD to EUR for example), and the spot price of commodities (such as corn and oil) are determined by the laws of supply and demand. When in-demand supplies are created in surplus, prices typically go down when demand remains constant. Likewise, a supply shortage tends to make prices appreciate (assuming demand remains constant). This dynamic also holds true for BTC and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin Price Markets: Then and Now\n\nOn May 22, 2010, 10,000 BTC were exchanged for two pizzas in what is widely considered the first BTC purchase (at the time, one BTC was worth $0.004). Subsequently, others started accepting goods and services in exchange for Bitcoin which created a market big enough for robust price discovery \u2014 which is simply the free market method for determining an asset\u2019s price. Since then, people have purchased everything from luxury goods to real estate using BTC.\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day 2020: How two Papa John's pies became famous\n\nSince 2010, the price has risen dramatically as demand has typically outpaced supply. From July 2020 onwards, the Bitcoin price has remained above $10,000 and reached an all-time high price of $69,990.90 in November 2021. Eschewing BTC-to-pizza markets, price discovery is now determined primarily on centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) where BTC is traded for fiat (USD, EUR, KRW) and a variety of other cryptocurrencies such as ether (ETH) and litecoin (LTC).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Is BTC in Demand?\n\nPut simply, many who purchase and use BTC view it as a fiat currency and payment system alternative. With its limited supply and decentralized nature, some purchase it as an inflation hedge, store of value, or as an investment. Others who have lost confidence in their banking system or national currency prefer an asset that is difficult to confiscate and doesn\u2019t need a trusted third party to make transactions.\n\nBitcoin Price Predictions Vary Widely\n\nFrom being called a \u201cglobal reserve currency\u201d to \u201cabsolutely worthless,\u201d Bitcoin price forecasts vary from zero to over $1 million. Ultimately, the opinions of Bitcoin proponents and detractors won\u2019t determine the price. Like fiat exchange rates and the price of other assets, BTC\u2019s market price is determined by the laws of supply and demand."

        "content": "The jump in risk assets came after U.S. regulators announced plans Sunday night to backstop all the depositors in failed Silicon Valley Bank and make additional funding available for other banks.\n\nBitcoin rose more than 15% to $24,382.98, according to Coin Metrics, and is now about 19% above its Friday levels. Since the January rally in risk assets began to fizzle out, chart analysts have been looking for a meaningful break above $25,000 .\n\nCryptocurrencies surged on Monday, even after regulators Sunday announced the closure of Signature Bank, the last major crypto bank in the U.S.\n\nInvestors were also betting Monday that the Fed will be less aggressive in raising interest rates now that authorities have stepped in to limit the fallout from SVB and Signature.\n\nCrypto initially moved higher amid a broader rally in risk assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 eventually turned lower and ended the day in the red, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished on an up note, however.\n\n\"A slower hiking pace and a lower terminal rate, plus the likely injection of liquidity to prop up banks struggling to meet withdrawals (through the Bank Term Funding Program) imply greater market liquidity, even if this could be partially offset by higher volatility,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and writer of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter.\n\n\"Bitcoin is one of the most sensitive assets to market liquidity, since its 'risk' profile is unencumbered by earnings or ratings concerns,\" she said.\n\nThe last major crypto bank\n\nThe Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC disclosed in Sunday's joint statement that Signature Bank was closed the same day, in a bid to prevent the spreading banking crisis.\n\n\"Both banks had little diversification,\" Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs, said of Signature and Silicon Valley Bank . \"With high risk often comes high reward, however, if the balance sheet behind the system crashes \u2013 while you have a Fed removing liquidity from the system and hiking rates \u2013 crypto startups and venture capitalists may have a long road to recovery.\"\n\n\"It is a complex matter in the near term,\" she added. \"News of the Fed creating a backstop helped to bolster equities and crypto overnight, however, as panic sets in we will have to see how today's market holds up.\"\n\nCrypto prices rose Monday in the face of that closure, despite it adding to fears by crypto investors and entrepreneurs that regulators are crushing the industry by pressuring banks to cut off their businesses.\n\nSignature Bank was another famously crypto-friendly institution and the next biggest one next to Silvergate , which announced its impending liquidation last week. Wall Street analysts Friday had maintained buy ratings on Signature Bank, even as the bad news around Silvergate and SVB unfolded.\n\nThe end of the Silvergate-Signature duo leaves crypto with few \"on-ramps\" that allow fiat money to flow into crypto assets. They helped solve this problem by creating easy banking services and payment platforms for crypto companies; namely, the Silvergate Exchange Network and Signature's Signet platform."
