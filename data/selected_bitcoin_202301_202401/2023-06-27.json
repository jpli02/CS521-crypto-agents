On Tuesday, it was up 2.2%.Fidelity did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.A spot bitcoin ETF is a publicly-traded investment vehicle that tracks the price of bitcoin and offers investors exposure to the asset class. On the other hand, futures-based bitcoin ETFs track the price of bitcoin futures contracts and have been viewed more favorably by the SEC Fidelity had previously dipped its toes in the crypto ETF space. It applied for a spot bitcoin ETF in 2021, but its proposal was rejected by the SEC, which said it did not meet the standards to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices.SEC Chair Gary Gensler's tough approach to crypto companies has earned him the \"bad cop\" reputation among industry players.The regulator is also locked in a dispute with Grayscale Investment , which sued the SEC for rejecting its application last June to convert its flagship spot Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF."

        "content": "Solity Network, a leading technology company, has unveiled its latest innovation: the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard.\n\nMunich, Germany, June 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solity Network, a leading technology company, is thrilled to unveil its latest innovation: the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard. This innovative platform aims to alter the way individuals and businesses comprehend the fundamental workings of Bitcoin by giving a comprehensive view of its liquidity and exclusive monitoring of changes.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s dominant market position makes it an essential starting point for anybody exploring the cryptocurrency market. It\u2019s a springboard for learning everything about the fascinating nuances of the crypto domain. Bitcoin gives investors a solid foundation to explore the vast crypto environment and discover its untapped possibilities.\n\nIn addition, Bitcoin is the initial gateway for numerous investors stepping into the realm of cryptocurrencies. Being the most widely recognized and adopted digital currency, Bitcoin garners a significant portion of the liquidity within the cryptocurrency space. Consequently, any alterations or developments concerning Bitcoin directly and immediately impact the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.\n\nHowever, it is often underestimated that risks exist not only within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols but also within Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks, especially when combined with DeFi protocols. To illustrate this point, let\u2019s consider the example of a significant price drop. Such an event can have an impact not just on DeFi protocols but also on the underlying L1 and L2 networks. Understanding the significance of L1 networks becomes crucial in this context.\n\nThe Solity Network platform offers a comprehensive and real-time Bitcoin Insights Dashboard to address this interconnectedness. This tool provides users with up-to-date data and in-depth analysis of the evolving dynamics of Bitcoin. Furthermore, by presenting a comprehensive overview of Bitcoin\u2019s liquidity, the dashboard empowers users to monitor fluctuations and correlations within the cryptocurrency market closely. This capability enhances risk assessment and facilitates informed decision-making within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn a statement by Marijo Radman, the CTO and Co-Founder of Solity Network, he mentioned: \u201cFor DeFi to go mainstream the underlying dynamics of Bitcoin and its interconnectedness to the DeFi space have to be understood in depth. The Bitcoin Insights Dashboard is the first step in that direction. Our mission is to create more transparency and make it accessible to everyone to foster DeFi adoption.\u201d\n\nWith the Bitcoin Insights Dashboard launch, Solity Network solidifies its position as an industry leader in blockchain risk solutions. The company\u2019s dedication to innovation and the advancement of the crypto landscape propels them to develop groundbreaking tools that enable investors to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance.\n\nAbout Solity Network\n\nSolity Network provides the infrastructure for Decentralized Finance to enable the real-time processing of fundamental risks across chains, protocols, and liquidity pools.

        "title": "Bitcoin's Booming and Black Rock Files for ETF. What Does This Mean For Ethereum & Altcoins like Caged Beasts? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "As the bull market gains momentum and Bitcoin\u2019s (BTC) price continues to surge, the spotlight is shining on altcoins and their potential to follow in Bitcoin\u2019s footsteps. Following unveiling the private Bitcoin Trust in August last year, BlackRock\u2019s (BLK) iShares lodged with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) yesterday to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nWith Bitcoin\u2019s price skyrocketing by 4.5% in the last 24-hr, the highest since April, investors are becoming more optimistic about the likelihood of BlackRock and other institutional players investing in digital assets. What could this mean for Bitcoin? Will Ethereum (ETH) follow in the footsteps of Bitcoin, and how much of it affect other altcoins such as Caged Beasts (BEASTS)? Let\u2019s discuss and learn all about it.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF: The Gateway to Mainstream Adoption\n\nThe Black Rock Bitcoin ETF has attracted significant interest within the financial realm as an exchange-traded fund that focuses exclusively on Bitcoin. By investing in this ETF, individuals can benefit from Bitcoin\u2019s price fluctuations without possessing the actual cryptocurrency, meaning the risk is less. This ETF effectively connects conventional finance with cryptocurrencies, appealing to institutional investors and those desiring a regulated investment option.\n\nComparing Black Rock Bitcoin ETF with direct cryptocurrency ownership has various benefits. First off, it offers simplicity and accessibility that attracts a broader spectrum of investors. Some security issues with traditional Bitcoin exchanges are reduced when trading on licensed exchanges. Additionally, the ETF structure promotes liquidity and transparency, attracting institutional investors who have previously hesitated to enter the cryptocurrency market.\n\nThe significance of the Black Rock Bitcoin ETF lies in its potential to accelerate the adoption of Bitcoin among mainstream investors. Introducing a regulated investment vehicle tied to Bitcoin reduces barriers to entry and establishes a sense of trust and legitimacy in the market. This development could lead to increased institutional participation, which may contribute to the long-term stability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum: The Catalyst for Altcoin Season\n\nThe efficiency and adaptability of Ethereum render it a desirable investment prospect. As the foundation of countless DApps and digital initiatives, Ethereum has become a dominant force in the cryptocurrency industry. Thanks to its robust infrastructure and vibrant developer community, the Ethereum platform is constantly improving and innovating. Ethereum is likely to be an accurate store of value, and its staking functionality makes it possible to earn passive revenue.\n\nWhile Bitcoin\u2019s price movements often dominate headlines, Ethereum has the potential to act as a catalyst for altcoin surges. After a 2-day short struggle with altcoins such as Cardano and Chainlink, they have returned to their position. As the second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum\u2019s price movements often influence the overall sentiment and performance of the altcoin market. Ethereum can create a domino effect, driving up the value of other altcoins. This presents investors with opportunities to capitalize on the growth potential of various altcoins.\n\nCaged Beasts: The Altcoin You Need\n\nIn the realm of altcoins, meme coins have gained considerable attention due to their unique appeal and community-driven nature. Caged Beasts is an emerging meme coin that has captured the imagination of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. With a focus on community engagement and utility, Caged Beasts aim to stand out in a crowded market and establish itself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nTheir referral bonus provides an additional 20% on Tether (USDT) tokens, increasing the potential for passive income generation. And owing to a novel referral program, early investors are able to go on an exhilarating journey with these additional advantages. Caged Beasts have piqued people\u2019s interest with their attractive staking incentives and alluring memes by creating a thriving ecosystem and encouraging a sense of belonging among investors. Given its numerous positive elements, Caged Beasts have the ability to transform how meme currencies are used.\n\nBlack Rock Bitcoin ETF\u2019s emergence as a regulated investment vehicle for Bitcoin paves the way for mainstream adoption and opens doors for institutional investors. Ethereum\u2019s position as a leading blockchain platform and influence on altcoin performance highlights its significance in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Caged Beasts represent meme coins\u2019 creative and community-driven nature with utility, appealing to investors seeking unique and engaging opportunities.\n\nCaged Beasts Website: https://cagedbeasts.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/CAGED_BEASTS\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/CAGEDBEASTS"

        "content": "Print this page\n\nSpeculation that BlackRock will finally break the US regulators\u2019 decade-long resistance to exchange traded funds based on bitcoin has fuelled a rally in the token to its highest level in a year.\n\nOptimism among crypto traders has soared in the two weeks since the world\u2019s largest money manager filed an application to run the first publicly traded spot bitcoin ETF in the US. Bitcoin, the most popular digital token, has soared by a fifth to more than $30,000.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application has pitted a group with a substantial record of ETF approvals against the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has repeatedly rejected industry efforts for an ETF based on trading in the underlying bitcoin asset.\n\nSupporters argue a cheap and regulated asset in the world\u2019s largest investment market would encourage more investors and hope the financial muscle of the asset manager will succeed where others have failed. The SEC has three months to assess the application.\n\n\u201cThe BlackRock ETF is likely to be approved,\u201d said Dave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry.\n\n\n\nBlackRock has \u201cpretty much undercut all the SEC\u2019s arguments other than \u2018meh, we don\u2019t like bitcoin\u2019, so I think they have a very reasonable chance,\u201d he added.\n\nDozens of asset managers have applied to launch such a fund since the Winklevoss twins, the entrepreneurs, made the first filing in 2013, when bitcoin was trading at about $1,000.\n\nDigital assets dashboard Click here for real-time data on crypto prices and insights\n\nThe SEC has yet to pass an application for an ETF based on the underlying bitcoin asset, which is traded on unregulated exchanges. The agency says it cannot offer investors guarantees the market is free from fraud and manipulation.\n\n\n\nThe only crypto-ETFs the US has approved are based on bitcoin futures contracts, which are listed and monitored on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated market.\n\nBoth ETF and crypto markets are hoping to ride in BlackRock\u2019s slipstream. Invesco, WisdomTree, Bitwise, Ark Investment Management and Valkyrie have all had spot bitcoin ETF filings rejected in the past but have refiled their applications, with some modifications. Ark is ahead of BlackRock in the filing queue, with the SEC due to make a ruling on its application by August 13.\n\nThe discount to the net asset value of the $18.9bn Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the world\u2019s largest crypto fund, has narrowed sharply to a nine-month low of 31.3 per cent. Grayscale is suing the SEC for its refusal to allow it to convert GBTC into an ETF, a move that, if allowed, would probably see the discount disappear.\n\nPart of the optimism stems from BlackRock\u2019s formidable record. According to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the asset manager has had 575 filings approved by the SEC and only one rejection. He put the odds of approval on this occasion at 50-50. Both BlackRock and the SEC declined to comment.\n\nIts application is also subtly different from those that have gone before. The chief difference is that the Nasdaq exchange, where the iShares Bitcoin Trust would be listed, \u201cis expecting to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with an operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for bitcoin\u201d.\n\nIn previous rejections the SEC has said a deal on surveillance \u201cwith a regulated market of significant size\u201d was one way for an applicant to meet its obligations to prevent fraud and manipulation in the underlying market.\n\nCoinbase is the proposed custodian for the fund and widely expected to be BlackRock\u2019s chosen exchange.\n\n\u201cIf Nasdaq is able to enter into an agreement with an exchange such as Coinbase, that could theoretically clear a pathway towards approval since it would directly address the SEC\u2019s main concern\u201d, allowing regulators \u201cto monitor for and pursue bad actors\u201d, said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, a financial adviser.\n\nHowever, Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar, felt BlackRock was only \u201cedging closer to addressing [the SEC\u2019s] concerns\u201d.\n\nWhile a surveillance-sharing effort with a cryptocurrency exchange \u201cis certainly better than having zero insight into the underlying market\u201d, he argued that manipulation could still be occurring on other exchanges, which would influence the price of bitcoin.\n\nGeraci suggested the new EDX Markets exchange, which launched this week, \u201ccould be the exact solution needed to get the SEC comfortable\u201d.\n\nThe marketplace is backed by Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities and only allows accredited members to trade on it, much like Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. But Geraci admitted it needed to generate sufficient volume for the SEC to consider it as \u201csignificant size\u201d.\n\nMoreover, the SEC also sued Coinbase this month, alleging it violated US securities law by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency.
