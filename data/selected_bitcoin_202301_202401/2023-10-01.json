This chart shows Bitcoin's volatility since 2016, and it is eye-opening, to say the least. At a glance, you can see how Bitcoin's current volatility is clearly at historical lows. Annualized volatility previously approached 100% to 200% during certain periods, and now it's around 10%:\n\nData by TradingView\n\nIs this the new norm?\n\nOne view about this extraordinary change to Bitcoin volatility is that this is the new norm. As Bitcoin goes increasingly mainstream and as more institutional investors boost their allocation to crypto, Bitcoin could lose some of its volatility. Quite simply, large institutional investors (think pension funds and university endowments) have much longer investment horizons than speculators and traders, and this should help reduce some of the zigs and zags in Bitcoin's price.\n\nThere is some evidence to support this theory beyond just lower volatility figures. For example, the supply of Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges appears to be on the downswing. The basic idea here is that, as more Bitcoin goes off-exchange for secure long-term holding, less Bitcoin can be traded on the major crypto exchanges, and this should reduce volatility.\n\nOr is it the calm before the storm?\n\nHowever, the opposing point of view is that the current period is the proverbial \"calm before the storm.\" Quite simply, this unprecedented period of lower volatility could precede a major spike in volatility as Bitcoin explodes in value. In the past, this has been the pattern with Bitcoin. In two different cases, a prolonged period of relatively low volatility led to Bitcoin skyrocketing in value. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance.\n\nImpact on Bitcoin price targets\n\nVolatility is important because it directly impacts the future price trajectory of Bitcoin. High volatility increases the chances of major price swings, both to the upside and the downside. In short, it's what makes huge Bitcoin rallies possible. These rallies draw in speculators and short-term traders, making Bitcoin even more volatile.\n\nThus, when you hear investors suggesting that Bitcoin could soar to $100,000 or skyrocket to $1 million within a very short period, they are likely assuming that Bitcoin's volatility will eventually return to its previous levels. This is what enables huge price swings over a relatively short period.\n\nBut what if lower volatility is the new norm? Well, then, the chances of Bitcoin spiking to $100,000 anytime soon are very much limited. At this point, it is still too early to say that Bitcoin's volatility is in permanent decline. Crypto has always been a risky, highly volatile asset class, and Bitcoin's current volatility could simply be a historical aberration.\n\nBut maybe it's not, considering all the new institutional money flowing into Bitcoin.

This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong. Investing in cryptocurrency and crypto assets is high risk. Don\u2019t invest unless you\u2019re prepared to lose all the money you invest. This is a high-risk investment, and you should not expect to be protected if something goes wrong.\n\nThere's an old aviation joke that asks \"How do you make a million dollars in the airline business\"? The punchline (\"Start with two million dollars\") is a bit of hyperbole but there is a kernel of truth to it. Much of the same can be said for investing in Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency. Unless you got in on the ground floor in the early 2010s or get incredibly lucky, you're unlikely to make any life-changing amounts of money in cryptocurrency. In this article, we'll take a look at Bitcoin, what it means to invest in cryptocurrency and some alternatives that have a better track record of historical success.\n\nWhat Is Bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular form of cryptocurrency (introduced in 2009), many people use the two terms interchangeably. But Bitcoin is just one form of cryptocurrency \u2014 some other forms are Ethereum, Litecoin or Dogecoin. Cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that is backed by a form of cryptography often referred to as the blockchain. Because of the way that cryptocurrencies are set up, they are nearly impossible to counterfeit. There are a few ways that you can invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The easiest way to invest in Bitcoin is to simply get a Bitcoin wallet and buy Bitcoins. We recommend Coinbase for U.S. investors \u2013 it\u2019s the easiest, links to your bank account, and allows you to buy and sell Bitcoins. Plus, if you open an new account, Coinbase will give you a $5 Bitcoin bonus when you make your first trade! Another way is to If you want to invest in an ETF through your broker, check out the GBTC. This ETF tracks Bitcoin, and you can invest in fractional shares. Another option is mining for Bitcoins, since as long as the markets remain active you can basically make money for nothing. But the problem is, mining is such a tough gig now that it is hardly worth it. Turning your computer into a miner will likely make it noisy and heat up. It would likely take you a long time to even mine a single Bitcoin, by which time you probably would have spent more on electricity. Keep in mind that investing in Bitcoin is incredibly volatile. For almost all people, it is not a good idea to invest the majority of your portfolio in any form of cryptocurrency. If you really want to dabble in crypto investing, set aside a small portion of your investments \u2014 only enough that you would be comfortable losing entirely.\n\nWhen You Would Have Needed To Invest in Bitcoin To Be A Millionaire\n\nThe history of Bitcoin is volatile and turbulent. Long gone are the days that you could make a token investment in Bitcoin and become a bitcoin millionaire seemingly overnight. To give you a bit of context:\n\nInvesting $10 in Bitcoin in January 2011 would have turned into $1.2 million by March 2022 .\n\n. You'd have needed to invest $160 in Bitcoin in January 2012, $440 in January 2013 or $24,000 in January 2014 to have that same amount.\n\n\n\nBy January 2018, you'd have needed to invest nearly $450,000 in Bitcoin in order to have $1.2 million today.\n\n\n\nOver the last few years, we've seen a smaller and smaller rise in the price of Bitcoin. This doesn't mean that there isn't money to be made, but gone are the chances you can turn $10 into $1,000,000.\n\nThe \"Risks\" Of Becoming A Bitcoin Millionaire\n\nEven if you had invested in Bitcoin way back then, it would have taken nerves of steel to hold onto it through the year. Looking at the historical BTC chart, you'd have had to survive and hold through several periods where your investment lost nearly 50% of its value within the period of a few weeks.\n\nWith hindsight, it's easy to say that \"it's just $10\" if that's all you invested originally. But would you have been willing to not panic when your Bitcoin portfolio had gotten up near $1M and dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars overnight? Another risk of having all of your money in Bitcoin is finding places that will accept it as payment for goods and services. While it is becoming more and more prevalent to find a business that will accept cryptocurrency as payment, it is still relatively rare. You're not likely to be able to get bread and milk from the corner store by paying with crypto. Instead, you'll have to change your currency, likely incurring additional fees and taxes. Related: How Taxes On Cryptocurrencies Like Bitcoin Works\n\n\n\nAlternatives To Winning Big In Crypto\n\nIf you are an individual of \"normal\" risk tolerance, Bitcoins probably don\u2019t excite you too much. The risk/reward profile of the Bitcoin market is not going to be very appealing to the savvy investor. This is just a chance to either make a quick buck, or lose everything. That is one reason why most savvy investors will keep the majority of their money in reliable investments like index funds. Plus, depending on when you started investing, index funds may outperform Bitcoin anyway. For example, From March 2021 to March 2022, you'd see the following returns: Bitcoin: -21.28%\n\n-21.28% S&P 500: +14.49%\n\nYou would have done remarkably better investing in simple index funds over the last year than Bitcoin.\n\n"

        "content": "After rising about 80% in the first two quarters of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) fell roughly 11% in the third quarter ending September. However, there is a silver lining for the bulls because they managed a positive monthly close in September, the first since 2016.\n\nBuyers will try to build upon this momentum in October, which has a bullish track record. According to CoinGlass data, only 2014 and 2018 have produced negative monthly returns since 2013 in October. There is no guarantee that history will repeat itself but the data can be used as a good starting point to formulate strategies by traders.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nThe recent strength in Bitcoin has also boosted interest in altcoins. Select altcoins are trying to break above their respective overhead resistance levels, indicating the start of a robust recovery. The bullish momentum could pick up further if Bitcoin extends its relief rally to $28,000.\n\nNot all altcoins are expected to blast off to the upside. The cryptocurrencies that are showing strength are the ones that may lead the recovery higher. Let\u2019s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could outperform in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading above the moving averages since Sep. 28, which is a positive sign. This shows that the advantage is gradually tilting in favor of the buyers.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to stall the rally near $27,500 but the bulls have not given up much ground. This shows that every minor dip is being purchased. This increases the odds of a break above $27,500. The BTC/USDT pair could then retest the crucial overhead resistance at $28,143. This level may again attract aggressive selling by the bears.\n\nIf the price turns down sharply from $28,143, the pair could retest the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,630). A strong bounce off this level could kick the price above $28,143. The pair may subsequently climb to $30,000.\n\nThis bullish view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and dives below the solid support at $26,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the pair is taking support at the 20-EMA. This indicates that the bulls are trying to take charge. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily and they will try to halt the recovery in the zone between $27,300 and $27,500. The sellers will then have to yank the price below the 20-EMA to seize control.\n\nConversely, if bulls pierce the overhead resistance at $27,500, it will pave the way for a possible rally to $28,143. This level may witness a tough battle between the buyers and sellers.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) broke and closed above $1,370 on Sep. 26, indicating the start of a new uptrend. When an asset is in an uptrend, traders tend to buy on dips.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears tried to stall the up-move at $1,600 but the bulls purchased the dip at $1,432. This indicates that the sentiment remains positive and lower levels are being bought. If bulls propel the price above $1,600, the MKR/USDT pair could rally to $1,760 and then sprint to $1,909.\n\nContrary to this assumption, if the price turns down sharply and skids below $1,432, it could make room for a retest of the breakout level at $1,370. The bears will have to yank the price below this support to indicate that the uptrend may be over.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are fiercely protecting the overhead resistance at $1,600. If bulls want to keep their chances of continuing the uptrend alive, they will have to buy the dips to the 20-EMA.\n\nIf the price snaps back from the 20-EMA, the buyers will once again try to overcome the obstacle at $1,600 and start the next leg of the uptrend. Alternatively, a collapse to $1,432 and then to the 50-simple moving average may begin if the pair drops below the 20-EMA.\n\nAave price analysis\n\nAave (AAVE) is trying to break above the long-term downtrend line, indicating a potential trend change. The rebound off the 20-day EMA ($62.42) on Sep. 28 indicates a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips.\n\nAAVE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears will try to stall the recovery at the downtrend line but if bulls do not allow the price to slip back below the 20-day EMA, it will increase the likelihood of a break above it. The AAVE/USDT pair could thereafter start an up-move toward $88.\n\nThe 20-day EMA is the important support to watch on the downside. If this level cracks, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($58.82).\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth the upsloping 20-EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in command. The rally may face selling at the downtrend line but the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the 20-EMA.\n\nA strong rebound off the 20-EMA will open the doors for a possible rise above the downtrend line. The pair may first rally to $75 and next to $80. The bears will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA to break the tempo.\n\nRelated: Crypto synthetic assets, explained\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) has reached the overhead resistance at $2 for the third time within the past few days. The repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will improve the prospects of a rally above $2. If that happens, the RUNE/USDT pair could first rise to $2.28 and subsequently to $2.78.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the bulls have given up and the pair may then drop to $1.37.\n\nRUNE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling near the overhead resistance at $2 but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to skid and sustain below the 20-EMA. This suggests that lower levels are attracting buyers.\n\nIf bulls push and maintain the price above $2, it will signal the start of a new uptrend. The pair could then surge toward $2.35. On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will indicate the start of a deeper correction to the 50-SMA.\n\nInjective price analysis\n\nInjective (INJ) has been swinging inside a large range between $5.40 and $10 for the past several days. The price action inside a range can be random and volatile but when the boundaries are far apart, trading opportunities may arise.\n\nINJ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. The INJ/USDT pair could first rise to $8.28 where the bears may mount a strong resistance. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could pick up momentum and soar toward $10.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to defend the overhead resistance and quickly drag the price below the moving averages. The pair could then retest the immediate support at $6.36.\n\nINJ/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the overbought territory, suggesting that the bulls have a slight edge. The rally could reach $8.28 which is likely to act as a strong hurdle.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 20-EMA. A bounce off this level will indicate that the uptrend remains intact. Contrarily, a break below the 20-EMA will signal that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the price down to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

If this level cracks, it will suggest that bears remain active at higher levels. That could pull the price down to the 50-day SMA ($58.82).\n\nAAVE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth the upsloping 20-EMA and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that the bulls are in command. The rally may face selling at the downtrend line but the bulls will try to arrest the decline at the 20-EMA.\n\nA strong rebound off the 20-EMA will open the doors for a possible rise above the downtrend line. The pair may first rally to $75 and next to $80. The bears will have to sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA to break the tempo.\n\nRelated: Crypto synthetic assets, explained\n\nTHORChain price analysis\n\nTHORChain (RUNE) has reached the overhead resistance at $2 for the third time within the past few days. The repeated retest of a resistance level tends to weaken it.\n\nRUNE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf bulls do not give up much ground from the current level, it will improve the prospects of a rally above $2. If that happens, the RUNE/USDT pair could first rise to $2.28 and subsequently to $2.78.\n\nThis positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the bulls have given up and the pair may then drop to $1.37.\n\nRUNE/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 4-hour chart shows that the bears are selling near the overhead resistance at $2 but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to skid and sustain below the 20-EMA. This suggests that lower levels are attracting buyers.\n\nIf bulls push and maintain the price above $2, it will signal the start of a new uptrend. The pair could then surge toward $2.35. On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA, it will indicate the start of a deeper correction to the 50-SMA.\n\nInjective price analysis\n\nInjective (INJ) has been swinging inside a large range between $5.40 and $10 for the past several days. The price action inside a range can be random and volatile but when the boundaries are far apart, trading opportunities may arise.\n\nINJ/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in positive territory, indicating that bulls have the upper hand. The INJ/USDT pair could first rise to $8.28 where the bears may mount a strong resistance. If bulls overcome this barrier, the pair could pick up momentum and soar toward $10.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the upside, they will have to defend the overhead resistance and quickly drag the price below the moving averages. The pair could then retest the immediate support at $6.36.\n\nINJ/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nBoth moving averages are sloping up on the 4-hour chart and the RSI is in the overbought territory, suggesting that the bulls have a slight edge. The rally could reach $8.28 which is likely to act as a strong hurdle.\n\nOn the downside, the first support is at the 20-EMA. A bounce off this level will indicate that the uptrend remains intact. Contrarily, a break below the 20-EMA will signal that the bulls are booking profits. That may pull the price down to the 50-SMA.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
