        "content": "Despite recent hype surrounding Bitcoin and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs_, JPMorgan believes that Ethereum will outperform Bitcoin in 2024.\n\nIn a Dec. 13 report, JPMorgan analysts wrote, \"We believe that next year Ethereum will reassert itself and recapture market share within the crypto ecosystem.\"\n\nThe analysts reason that the Ethereum EIP-4844 upgrade, also known as the Proto-Danksharding upgrade, is expected to take place during the first half of 2024 and is part of a multistep plan to make sharding more efficient on the Ethereum chain.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThough the process is complex, the idea is that it will allow shards to be analyzed in larger groups instead of a system that splits Ethereum into several shard chains. This upgrade will have a significant impact on Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon and Optimism. This is because it will allow these projects to have more access to network power, which will increase throughput and reduce transaction costs.\n\nJPMorgan believes that these upgrades will bring more investors to Ethereum and cause it to regain market share in the crypto sphere.\n\nJPMorgan is not saying that the price of Ethereum will appreciate. The analysts are \"cautious\" about crypto markets in 2024. They see Ethereum as one of the stronger tokens for 2024. While it may not go up in price, they still believe that it will perform better than other tokens, specifically Bitcoin.\n\nTrending: This brokerage offers custom rewards for users to switch \u2013 the biggest reward so far for 1 user is $19,977.48. Will yours beat it?\n\nDespite recent hype around spot Bitcoin ETF approvals and the upcoming Bitcoin halving, JPMorgan is still more bullish on ETH. The analysts believe that the spot Bitcoin ETFs are already priced in. Since approval seems imminent, they believe that markets have already priced in the impact this will have on Bitcoin. They cite the recent Bitcoin run-up as evidence for this.\n\nStory continues\n\nThey also think that the upcoming Bitcoin halving is already priced in. They looked at the ratio of Bitcoin's market price to production cost and saw that it decreased after the most recent halving in 2020. They expect a similar move will follow in 2024.\n\nOther topics discussed in the report revolved around their lack of confidence in decentralized finance (DeFi). They have not seen noticeable impacts of DeFi on the current financial system.\n\n\"The biggest applications of blockchain to traditional finance, i.e. overnight repo transactions via smart contracts in blockchain platforms hosted by companies such as Broadridge and JPMorgan, take place outside public blockchains,\" the analysts said. They also discussed interoperability and central bank digital currencies.\n\nRead Next:\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article JPMorgan Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin In 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "MicroStockHub / iStock.com\n\nFollowing last year\u2019s disastrous landscape for the crypto ecosystem \u2014 a year marred by scandals, collapses, losses and lawsuits \u2014 2023 fared better. While the industry is still reeling from these developments, some assets have been slowly gaining ground.\n\nLost Money on Crypto in 2023? This Trick Could Help You Pay 0% Capital Gains Tax\n\nFind: 3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nIn turn, many experts argue that 2024 is off to a good start, with some cryptos poised to significantly progress. As of Dec. 20, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $1.72 trillion, according to CoinGecko.\n\nBitcoin\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $44,130\n\nPast year: up 160.9%\n\nYear-to-date: up 166.46%\n\nPast 30 days: up 17.8%\n\nAll-time high: $68,789.63 on Nov. 10, 2021\n\nMany experts are very bullish on Bitcoin for 2024 due to a combination of factors that could provide a perfect storm situation for the asset.\n\nAs David Waugh, lead analyst at Coinbits, explained, one significant development is the expected approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) in January- which could result- according to analysts from Galaxy Research- in $14.4 billion of institutional inflows into Bitcoin in the first year, exerting significant upward pressure on its price.\n\nAnother factor is that by the end of this year, Congress could also pass comprehensive crypto legislation providing the industry with much-needed regulatory clarity, making Bitcoin more attractive to banks \u2013 allowing banks to work with Bitcoin companies to enhance the services they can offer consumers, he said.\n\nFinally, another key catalyst is the Bitcoin halving event slated for April, which occurs once every four years and has always been associated with a massive price increase in the months before and after the event, according to Ric Edelman, founder, Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals.\n\n\u201cThe impact of these developments on bitcoin\u2019s price are expected to be substantial, with many predicting future bitcoin prices of $100,000 to $1.5 million,\u201d said Edelman. \u201cI\u2019m expecting Bitcoin\u2019s price to reach $150,000 by Dec 2025.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nEthereum\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $2,255\n\nPast year: up 84.7%\n\nYear-to-date: up 87.9%\n\nPast 30 days: up 10.3%\n\nAll-time high: $4,891.70 on Nov. 16, 2021\n\nEther underperformed Bitcoin in 2023 with a gain of \u201conly\u201d 80%, trading roughly in line with its peer group in the smart contract platforms crypto sector, said Zach Pandl, Grayscale\u2018s managing director of research.\n\nPandl added that there has been extensive debate about Ethereum\u2019s competitive landscape as 2023 comes to a close, and he expects this to continue into 2024.\n\n\u201cGrayscale Research remains optimistic about Ethereum\u2019s outlook despite better performance from some other Smart Contract Platform tokens in 2023 (such as SOL or AVAX), as Ethereum network will go through an upgrade in the first quarter, that could support is \u201cmodular\u201d scaling plan,\u201d he said. Another driver could be any progress on the regulatory approval on spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. market, which could support token valuation, as well, he added.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $0.621\n\nPast year: up 78.2%\n\nYear-to-date: up 84.25%\n\nPast 30 days: 0.00%\n\nAll-time high: Jan. 4, 2018, at $3.84\n\nAs Aaron Rafferty\u2019s CEO of StandardDAO and co-founder of BattlePACs, while XRP has increased significantly, it still remains 81.78% below its all-time high.\n\n\u201cWe have seen a turbulent albeit positive year with an SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) win and many acquisitions out of Ripple including toward real world asset tokenization,\u201d he said. \u201cExpect strong price trends for this payment rail.\u201d\n\nChainlink\n\nPrice as of Dec. 20: $14.66\n\nPast year: up 142%\n\nYear-to-date: up 164.85%\n\nPast 30 days: down 3.3%\n\nAll-time high: May 9, 2021, at $52.88\n\nAccording to Rafferty, the year-to-date rise demonstrates robust growth potential, standing 74% below its peak.\n\n\u201cPast bull run gains were 1400%+ and typically run prior to other players,\u201d he said. \u201cLINK\u2019s expansion into enterprise solutions, including collaborations with major players like Google, SWIFT, and Oracle, provides a vital security layer between blockchains and real-world data.\u201d\n\nOther Assets and Trends\n\nLee Taylor, the founder of MonarchX, said that in addition to Chainlink, if you\u2019re looking for the unicorn altcoins of 2024, I think Solana, Avalanche and Algorand should be top performers.\n\n\u201cALGO, which features low costs, is particularly well-suited to content creators. While seeing a dip earlier this year, it is up a whopping 38% over the past month, and it should continue to see high growth into 2024,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, AVAX is in a similar position, up over 75% in the past month alone. It is likely that these unicorns are well-positioned to see 100% growth over the next year.\n\nBitcoin-related assets, which have been on a roll lately, are also something worth watching, according to several experts.\n\nFor instance, \u201cOrdinals\u201d -NFTs on Bitcoin- or, as Decrypt explained, \u201cdigital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin,\u201d have garnered a lot of interest lately.\n\nNow, whether they have staying power remains to be seen, according to Grayscale\u2019s Pandl.\n\nAccording to Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, building on Bitcoin-related assets and networks is a big trend in the coming year.\n\n\u201cThere are many people who had never touched Bitcoin \u2013 they\u2019re altcoiners \u2013 who are now getting into Bitcoin because of Ordinals and other related assets,\u201d he said. \u201cBitcoin has the most liquidity of any decentralized network, and it\u2019s also the most secure, so this all makes BTC more desirable. Bitcoin\u2019s network effects are powerful, and I think we\u2019ll see the broader Bitcoin ecosystem flourish in the year ahead.\u201d\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Why Bitcoin, Ethereum and 2 More Cryptos Are Poised To Boom in 2024"
