        "title": "Michael Saylor and the Philosophy of Bitcoin Maximalism - DailyCoin",
        "content": "In 2020, Micheal Saylor made a shocking announcement on an earning call with shareholders. He painted a bleak picture for the future of fiat currency and argued that the returns from holding cash were falling, and the strength of the dollar was fading.\n\nConsequentially, Saylor argued, the smartest thing would be to hold the currency of the future instead of fiat. He said the future was Bitcoin, which was attractive because it was a dependable store of value.\n\nSaylor said he believed that the way forward for MicroStrategy was to buy Bitcoin with its cash reserves. At the time, MicroStrategy had reserves of about $550 million. Since the company only needed around $50 million on hand to operate, Saylor had enough leeway to invest as much as he could in Bitcoin.\n\nSaylor controlled over 70% of MicroStrategy\u2019s voting shares, so he technically had supreme control over the company.\n\nBitcoin Maximalism\n\nIn the short term, Saylor\u2019s investment paid off. MicroStrategy bought over twenty thousand Bitcoins in August 2020 at an average price of around $11,500.\n\nMicroStrategy announced in December 2020 that it had bought a total of 70,000 Bitcoins with an average purchase price of around $16,000. As MicroStrategy bought Bitcoins, so did Michael Saylor.\n\nIn October 2020, Saylor announced that he\u2019d personally purchased 17,732 bitcoin at an average price of $9,882. By October 2021, the Bitcoin Saylor personally held was worth over a billion dollars. When he made the purchase, he\u2019d paid over two hundred million. That reflected an unrealized capital gain of over 500% in a year. Not even the best-performing hedge funds could offer such astonishing returns.\n\nSaylor had gone all in on Bitcoin and reaped extraordinary returns. The share price of MicroStrategy was rising due to its crypto investment, and Saylor\u2019s wealth was ballooning out of control.\n\nIf Saylor was only in it for the money, he might have started selling at the top. His investment had seen a 500% increase, and he\u2019d made as much money as anyone could make in under a year. But Saylor didn\u2019t just see Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. He saw it as the currency of the future, and the price of Bitcoin was a mere addendum. That\u2019s why in 2021, as Bitcoin started to slip and tumble down, he posted a tweet declaring he was a Bitcoin maximalist."

        "title": "The \u2018everything bubble\u2019 has popped and the experts on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley were spectacularly wrong about a ton of things - Fortune",
        "content": "Most people don\u2019t think about the Federal Reserve very often, and only a select few contemplate the effects that the U.S. central bank has on investors. But over the past few years, that\u2019s begun to change. Many economists and keen market watchers are making the case that years of loose monetary policies from the Fed and other central banks following the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) helped create an \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\u2014and now it\u2019s popping.\n\nThe everything bubble idea isn\u2019t new. For years before 2022\u2019s stock market woes, leading minds on Wall Street including the investing legend Jeremy Grantham warned about a brewing \u201csuperbubble.\u201d The idea is that near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing (QE)\u2014a policy where the Fed would buy mortgage-backed securities and government bonds to boost lending and investment in the economy\u2014pushed investors toward riskier investments, allowed unsustainable business models to thrive on cheap debt, and helped fuel the Pandemic Housing Boom.\n\nRenowned investment manager Jeremy Grantham believes we\u2019re in a \u201csuperbubble.\u201d Lane Turner\u2014The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but in retrospect a lot of outlandish financial predictions accompanied this era of easy money. And the fallout for Americans hasn\u2019t been pretty, as inflation continues to rage and recession fears mount. But there is a silver lining for the finance community. The everything bubble provided some of the most ridiculous\u2014and hilarious\u2014forecasts in history.\n\nFrom cryptocurrency experts and hedge fund managers to economists and investment banks, the easy money era was filled with bulls who believed the good times would never end. Here\u2019s a look at some of their strangest calls.\n\nThe Bitcoin bulls\n\nThe cryptocurrency boom of 2020 and 2021 was unprecedented. Between January 2020 and the peak of the crypto fervor in November 2021, the industry\u2019s total value grew to over $3 trillion and Bitcoin prices soared roughly 800%.\n\nThe crypto faithful were sure that the party was just beginning. Billionaire venture capitalist Tim Draper said in June 2021 that Bitcoin would hit $250,000 by the end of 2022. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be right on this one,\u201d he assured CNBC\u2019s Jade Scipioni.\n\nBitcoin ended up finishing 2022 just above $16,500, but just last month, Draper repeated his call for Bitcoin to hit $250,000\u2014this time he said it would be by the middle of 2023.\n\n\u201cI expect a flight to quality and decentralized crypto like bitcoin, and for some of the weaker coins to become relics,\u201d Draper told CNBC.\n\nTim Draper did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDraper wasn\u2019t the only leading figure to jump on the Bitcoin train during the easy money era and make lofty forecasts either. ARK Invest\u2019s Cathie Wood was the first public asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin via the Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) as a part of her tech-focused exchange-traded ETFs in 2015.\n\nArk Invest CEO Cathie Wood is long on Bitcoin and critical of FTX\u2019s Sam Bankman-Fried. Hugo Amaral\u2014SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nThe bet led Wood to face serious criticism from her peers, but barring a brief crypto winter in 2018, it paid off as Bitcoin\u2019s price soared to over $65,000 by November 2021.\n\nWood was sure that the good times would last throughout the bull market. In November 2020, she told Barron\u2019s that institutional adoption of crypto would drive Bitcoin\u2019s price to $500,000 by 2026 and repeatedly \u201cbought the dip\u201d whenever Bitcoin prices fell. Wood even told The Globe and Mail in a February 2020 interview that Bitcoin was \u201cone of the largest positions\u201d in her retirement account.\n\nThe ARK Invest CEO remained bullish even at the start of 2022, when Bitcoin prices had fallen from their highs of over $65,000 to just under $50,000. She argued that the leading cryptocurrency would touch $1 million by 2030 in ARK\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas 2022\u201d annual research report.\n\nSince then Bitcoin\u2019s price has dropped more than 60%, but Wood and her team aren\u2019t fazed, and still believe that their prediction is fair.\n\n\u201cWe think Bitcoin is coming out of this smelling like a rose,\u201d Wood told Bloomberg in December, arguing that institutions will eventually buy into Bitcoin after it is \u201cbattle tested\u201d by the crypto winter.\n\nCathie Wood did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, who previously served as chief equity strategist at JPMorgan and spent over 25 years on Wall Street, has also been a perennial Bitcoin bull. In early 2022, he predicted that Bitcoin would hit $200,000 in the coming years.\n\nAnd despite the recent fall, which he admitted has been \u201chorrific\u201d for investors, Lee told CNBC in November that he still believes Bitcoin will come out of the current downtrend and hit his target. But while many crypto forecasters are sticking by their lofty estimates, Wall Street has been walking back some of theirs.\n\nTom Lee did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLofty stock market forecasts\n\nInvestment banks made some pretty dramatic forecasts during the cheap money era. After the stock market soared throughout the pandemic, returning 28% to investors, Wall Street was confident that things would slow down in 2022, but not to the extent that they actually did.\n\nInvestment banks expected the S&P 500 to end 2022 at 4,825, representing only a mild 1% gain for the year. Instead, the blue-chip index dropped roughly 20%.\n\nThe (perhaps unwarranted) bullishness among investment banks was particularly clear when looking at the price targets for growth stocks that benefited from pandemic trends. The online used car retailer Carvana, for example, soared throughout the pandemic as used car prices rose to record highs.\n\nThe firm was able to take advantage of consumers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to shop for vehicles in person during COVID, leading some analysts to give incredibly bullish forecasts.\n\nIn January 2022, Morgan Stanley\u2019s auto analyst Adam Jonas called Carvana the \u201capex predator in auto retail\u201d and assigned a $430 12-month price target to the stock. Since then, shares of the online car retailer have plummeted more than 97% to just $4.48\u2014and some analysts believe more pain lay ahead for investors.\n\nMorgan Stanley has been fined $35 million after devices containing millions of its customers\u2019 data turned up in an online auction. Mario Tama\u2014Getty Images\n\nMorgan Stanley did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nNew Construct\u2019s CEO David Trainer warned investors in June that Carvana was burning cash at an unsustainable rate and may not survive.\n\n\u201cTime is running out for cash-burning companies kept afloat with easy access to capital,\u201d Trainer told Fortune. \u201cThese \u2018zombie\u2019 companies are at risk of going bankrupt.\u201d\n\nCoinbase is another example of the fervor that developed on Wall Street over the past few years. When the cryptocurrency exchange went public in April 2021, shares spiked from their $250 reference price to $381 per share.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund manager, took to Twitter after the IPO, saying that he \u201cliked Coinbase to $475.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t alone, investment banks\u2019 average price target for the exchange was over $400 per share in early 2021.\n\nSince then, however, Coinbase stock is down more than 90% amid the crypto winter. And Cramer has changed his mind, saying in a December 13 tweet that he was \u201cnot a buyer of Coinbase here,\u201d calling it \u201ctoo early.\u201d\n\nCNBC did not respond to Fortune\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe cheap money era may have led many forecasters to assume that asset prices would continue to soar, regardless of valuations, but this year has proven to be a wake-up call. Wall Street analysts have slashed their price targets for many of the stock market\u2019s pandemic darlings. It\u2019s a new era for markets and forecasters, as Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer of the investment advisory firm CapWealth, told Fortune last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be unwinding a lot of the speculation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of revaluation of everything from commercial real estate to how the investing public looks at things like crypto."
