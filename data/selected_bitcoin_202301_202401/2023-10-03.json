        "content": "\"So, you're looking at the ending of the Wild West period of crypto. Is that kind of what we're talking about?\" This question, posed by Kevin O'Leary during a recent discussion at Benzinga's Crypto Unlocked event, set the stage for a candid conversation about the future of cryptocurrency.\n\n\"Yes. And it's a good thing. Listen, I'm an investor. I want to see Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) at a hundred thousand dollars. It's never going to get there, ever, if it's never going to be owned by institutions. It's never going to be owned by institutions where the next crypto exchange gets sued every week. It's over. It's over. That's got to stop. And we've got to figure it out,\" O'Leary said.\n\nThe Shark Tank star and financial expert elaborated on the crucial need for institutional investment to drive the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to new heights. \"If we want institutions to get a 1% to 3% allocation so that you can start to see capital appreciation on crypto assets, we're going to need real money. We can't do it with the crypto community. It's too small. There's a fraction. It's a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the world financial system.\"\n\n\"We've got to open it up, and we've got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters, and you know, that's over. It's just over. And it's boring too. I'm sick of it,\" he added.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's 'Fake Pump Seems Over:' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nThe discussion, which took place ahead of Benzinga's upcoming conference in New York on Nov. 13, brought to light the challenges and opportunities facing the crypto space. O'Leary's candid remarks underscore the need for a regulatory framework that encourages institutional investment while mitigating risks associated with fraudulent activities in the crypto space.\n\nO'Leary is slated to be a keynote speaker at Benzinga's Fintech Deal Day & Awards, where attendees can use the code BZFINTECH to receive a 20% discount on their ticket purchase. The event, happening at Convene in NYC, will be followed by Benzinga Future of Digital Assets, further diving into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies and digital assets.\n\nHis conversation with Benzinga highlighted the urgent need for a shift from the 'Wild West' era of crypto, which has been characterized by a lack of regulation and a high level of speculative trading, to a more mature and stable financial ecosystem that can attract substantial investments from institutional investors.\n\nIt's clear from O'Leary's insights that for cryptocurrencies to realize their full potential, embracing institutional investment is a necessary evolution.\n\n\"We've got to get rid of the role players and the fraudsters\" says @kevinolearytv at Crypto Unlocked, advocating for institutional crypto investment.\n\nCatch him as a keynote speaker at Benzinga Fintech Deal Day & Awards.\n\nJoin us in NYC, on NOV 13!https://t.co/KOznB6N3h7 pic.twitter.com/Ly0Cq6R1zy\n\n\u2014 Benzinga (@Benzinga) October 2, 2023\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

Then we should see a short-term bounce around there, and then the last capitulation leg to $12,000.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the orchestrated price increases often involve familiar participants, false demand, and specific price action, with the ultimate aim of trapping investors and utilizing their positions as exit liquidity.\n\nCapo in a separate note last week, said that these movements are becoming weaker over time as their effectiveness diminishes. \"Same players, same fake demand, same PA.

        "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Tim Draper Reflects On Bitcoin ETF As Grayscale Announces New Ethereum Fund - Nasdaq",
        "content": "A Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) ETF is looking very likely, with the world's leading crypto asset manager, Grayscale, as a possible front-runner to be approved by the SEC. In the meantime, Grayscale is lengthening its lead by applying to convert the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) to a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nGrayscale will be speaking at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets event on Nov. 14 in NYC.\n\nThe Grayscale Ethereum Trust represents 2.5% of all ETH in circulation and is the largest ETH investment vehicle in the world. Grayscale stated that the ETHE trust has always been on the path to becoming an ETF. Currently, the Ethereum underlying the trust is discounted at 30%, but the ETH would be worth $5.14 billion at full market value.\n\nShares of ETHE spiked 6.15% in value following the announcement of the spot Ethereum ETF.\n\nTim Draper, a prominent investor and entrepreneur known for successful investments in companies such as Tesla, Skype, and Coinbase, gave Benzinga exclusive comments on the Grayscale spot BTC ETF application. To Draper, approval seems to be a matter of time: \"I am surprised it has taken so long. I'm not sure why the SEC approved futures and not spot trading. It seems capricious,\" Draper said.\n\nHe expects the availability of a spot Bitcoin ETF to encourage more adoption and investments in BTC.\n\n\"It will allow more people to participate in this new global, open, transparent, frictionless economy provided by Bitcoin and its blockchain. It will bring more light on the unbanked who can use Bitcoin to participate in the global economy,\" Draper said.\n\nAlso Read: Bitcoin's 'Fake Pump Seems Over:' Crypto Analyst Capo Predicts Price Drop To $12K\n\nOne month ago, Circuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote a DC Circuit Court of Appeals opinion that favored Grayscale's application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a more accessible Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). Rao's opinion said, in part, \"The Commission failed to adequately explain why it approved the listing of two Bitcoin futures ETPs but not Grayscale's proposed Bitcoin ETP. In the absence of a coherent explanation, this unlike regulatory treatment of like products is unlawful. We therefore grant Grayscale's petition for review and vacate the Commission's order.\"\n\nOther applicants for a spot BTC ETF include ARK Investment, BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity/Wise Origin, GlobalX, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, VanEck, and WisdomTree.\n\nInvestor, author, and Forbes contributor Clem Chambers said: \"It seems unlikely that there will be much of a gap between applicants if a BTC ETF is cleared\u2026 To me it's anyone's guess when it will be approved, but if the SEC had its way there will be no ETF unless they think it will be a negative for Bitcoin and crypto.\"\n\nThe legal victory in DC compels the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit the Grayscale application for a spot BTC ETF after rejecting it.\n\nBloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart welcomed the news by raising the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF to 75% by the end of 2023 and 95% by the end of 2024.\n\nFind out more about Bitcoin and its history.
