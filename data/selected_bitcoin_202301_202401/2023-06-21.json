At 6:39 p.m. ET, the price was $29,988.46.\n\nInvestors are growing bullish about the prospects of BlackRock and other major institutional names getting involved in digital assets.\n\nThat's despite all the bad news that's been surrounding the crypto space of late, with the market still reeling from the scandal of FTX's collapse and the ensuing regulatory fallout.\n\n\"The slate of spot bitcoin ETF application announcements by larger institutions has definitely brought back bullishness into the crypto markets,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of international markets at CoinDCX, India's largest crypto exchange, told CNBC.\n\n\"We also hit major support at $25K for BTC, and we've seen this move be driven more by pure spot buying rather than a short liquidation type move which is quite healthy,\" Ayyar said."

Read preview\n\nThere are exceptional and very ordinary aspects of the application BlackRock filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission last week to launch a exchange-traded fund that would track the price of bitcoin.\n\nBlackRock is a fund manager. It creates, manages, and distributes funds. It has 1,300 ETFs! This is literally what it does! And investors knew about the partnership BlackRock struck last year with Coinbase, the crypto exchange BlackRock said it would use as a bitcoin custodian on behalf of the iShares Bitcoin Trust if regulators approve it.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nThe effort to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, though, is a meaningful development in cryptoland. \"The future of crypto is more BlackRock and less Binance,\" Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, tweeted, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz tweeted that BlackRock launching a bitcoin ETF \"would be the best thing that could happen\" to bitcoin.\n\nWall Street's top regulator has so far rejected other, smaller asset managers' applications to launch similar vehicles. The crypto money manager Grayscale even sued the SEC last year after it tossed out Grayscale's application to turn a bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd a renewed commitment between the world's largest asset manager and Coinbase, which the SEC accused of violating securities laws earlier this month, may give the crypto company a reputational boost. (Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a tweet on June 6 that \"the complaint filed against us is exclusively focused on what is or is not a security,\" and that \"we are confident in our facts and the law.\")\n\nI've covered BlackRock's path to embracing crypto. Here's part of my inside story with Morgan Chittum from last fall, below, and here's a separate rundown of the BlackRock employees involved in crypto initiatives at the firm.\n\nBut even as crypto enthusiasts found advocates internally, people left. There was a \"line in BlackRock to do the fun work\" of working on digital assets or blockchain research full time, another former employee said.\n\nIt \"looked impossible for BlackRock to do anything\" significant in the space in the near term, the person said. \"That's why I think many of us left.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlackRock is now working on its partnerships with Coinbase and Circle and focusing on the four parts of its crypto strategy: stablecoins, tokenization, permissioned blockchains, and crypto assets.\n\nBlackRock leadership is highlighting those efforts. While acknowledging the \"steep downturn\" in crypto assets, Fink said on an earnings conference call this summer that the firm was still seeing \"more interest from institutional clients about how to efficiently access these assets.\"\n\nThe price of bitcoin has rallied near its highest level of 2023 in the days since BlackRock filed its application, eclipsing $30,000 on Wednesday. Potential implications for the wider digital assets ecosystem aside, it's worth examining other reactions to the application.\n\nCrypto influencers have seized on BlackRock's new crypto efforts, underscoring the relatively new scrutiny BlackRock faces from the everyday investors and the general public. Enter the outlandish comments about BlackRock's position in the crypto market, another front in the scrutiny around the firm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"So BlackRock, Citadel, Deutsche Bank and NASDAQ have all started to enter the crypto space in the last week. They've bullied out participants so they can scoop up cheap coins. The trajectory for crypto has never been more clear,\" one venture capitalist wrote to his 197,000 followers.\n\nA business podcast host tweeted to his 903,000 followers: \"They're not trying to kill crypto. They're trying to kill the current crypto industry and then hand it over to their cronies. Citadel, BlackRock, Schwab JPMorgan\u2026\" (These tweets refer to Citadel, the hedge fund founded and led by billionaire Ken Griffin. But it is market maker Citadel Securities, also founded by Griffin, that backed a recently launched crypto exchange called EDX.)\n\nA BlackRock spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nOf course, the firm's sheer size has long been the subject of criticism from regulators and officials who take issue with its dominance in the ETF market. But the ESG investing-related scrutiny that ramped up last year has brought a new awareness of BlackRock to the mainstream. That's pushed BlackRock to get ahead of theories and videos that spread widely online; I spoke with Rich Latour, the firm's global head of content and media about that a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've certainly done research, and we know that there's a perception that a lot is going on in BlackRock that people don't necessarily understand,\" Latour said last June."

        "title": "A Bitcoin Renaissance: It's Not All About the Price - Nasdaq",
        "content": "To say OG blockchain Bitcoin has proven impervious to assassination attempts would be a stretch, but it\u2019s certainly shown itself to be robust and resilient since Satoshi Nakamoto bequeathed it to the world nearly 15 years ago. Despite numerous attempts to undermine, ban, burn and bury it, it continues to operate as a highly efficient, highly secure settlement network and a beacon of hope for those who've become disillusioned by the traditional financial system.\n\nObsessively tracking the price movements of bitcoin (BTC) has turned into a favorite pastime of many, with detractors delighting in announcing Bitcoin\u2019s demise only to crawl back under a rock when it inevitably rides out the rough spells. But continually sweating the value of one\u2019s stack does a disservice to the slow, steady and unsexy work that continues to go into finessing Bitcoin\u2019s operation. That said, a lot of developments have been happening at the blockchain level in recent months, to the extent that the price of bitcoin, for once, has become almost an afterthought.\n\nEven if the BTC price goes down \u2013 and it may well notch its first month of losses in 2023 \u2013 it\u2019s possible that Bitcoin may, as a consequence of such developments, cement its status as the preeminent layer-1 chain by claiming its rightful place above a sea of imitators and competitors.\n\nFrom Ordinals to Mintlayer: Bitcoin\u2019s Roaring 2023\n\nThese developments cannot have escaped your attention. Propelled by surging activity on Ordinals, the protocol that belatedly brought NFTs to Bitcoin, Satoshi\u2019s network became the second biggest NFT blockchain in May. A fact made all the more staggering given Bitcoin NFTs didn\u2019t exist prior to January.\n\nNFT sales on Bitcoin blew other blockchains out of the water as users started obsessively inscribing satoshis with data including Jpegs and text. The hype, for once, was real \u2013 even if many hardline Bitcoiners view Ordinals and the so-called BRC-20 token standard as a distraction. Indeed, Samson Mow told Cointelegraph that he expects the \u2018unsustainable' hype around Ordinals and BRC20 tokens to fade away within a matter of months.\n\nThe success of Ordinals, not to mention subsequent bitcoin NFT support from the likes of Binance, can be set to one side: the blockchain\u2019s 2023 renaissance is about more than just non-fungible tokens. We see it with Babylon, a project that wants to leverage the security of Bitcoin to augment and enhance the security of other chains, specifically those in the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nEffectively, Babylon boosts the appeal of Bitcoin by functioning as a go-between between chains that need extra security and the gold-standard network. The project has ambitions to eventually get hundreds of chains using its service, since almost all will benefit from an extra layer of security. Just announced by its lead researcher, David Tse of Stanford University, a BTC staking protocol \u2013 the first of its kind, that allows BTC holders to participate in staking of other PoS networks. This new mechanism finally lends the famed security of the bitcoin blockchain for other, less secure PoS smart contract blockchain protocols.\n\nAnother project extending Bitcoin\u2019s function and enhancing its reputation is a collaboration between Swiss non-profit ZeroSync Association and infrastructure firm Blockstream. The partners are planning to broadcast Bitcoin zero-knowledge proofs from Blockstream\u2019s satellite, enabling the network\u2019s nodes to sync quickly from anywhere on Earth.\n\nGiven that one weapon of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) aimed at Bitcoin suggests an internet blackout could destroy it, this seems like a worthwhile endeavor. Favoring ZK-proofs frees nodes from the need to download Bitcoin\u2019s 500GB of data and ensures expeditious syncing rather than a slow, methodical grind. The partnership has earmarked late 2023 for the first experimental broadcast from Blockstream\u2019s satellite network.\n\nThe DeFi boom of a few years back, followed by the arrival of GameFi and NFTs, may have created the impression that Bitcoin was being left behind. Or perhaps left to its devices, the better to focus on its original raison d\u2019etre as a store of value. Yet that impression is changing, and there is a growing sense that the single-function decentralized garden is opening up and coming into bloom. Forget the price of bitcoin for a second; the recent mood music may represent a new ascent of Bitcoin as a chain for all seasons.\n\nCan DeFi live on Bitcoin? It\u2019s a question many have mulled since DeFi Summer began in earnest three years ago. Now that we have Bitcoin-based NFTs, as well as layer-2 solutions like Mintlayer which let users build a DeFi ecosystem rooted in Bitcoin, it\u2019s no longer in the realms of the hypothetical.\n\nAs a Bitcoin sidechain supported by the Lightning Network, Mintlayer dispenses with the need for wrapped tokens or blockchain bridges (as well as their smart contract vulnerabilities), enabling users to directly exchange BTC using atomic swaps. Mintlayer can be used to create DEXs, lending platforms, marketplaces and much else besides, and the project counts Bitcoin Foundation founder Charlie Shrem as an advisor.\n\nAlthough launched in 2020, Mintlayer has found traction this year perhaps as a consequence of last year\u2019s many bridge exploits, not to mention a growing desire among bitcoiners to use BTC directly for DeFi plays. In April, the project announced a $4 million grants initiative to aid the development of Bitcoin-centric DeFi tools and resources.\n\nWhile Mintlayer has grand visions of bringing DeFi to Bitcoin, EVM rollup platform Rollux is leveraging Bitcoin\u2019s unrivaled security to facilitate fast, cheap, and secure transactions at scale. The brainchild of SYS Labs, Rollux\u2019s mainnet is set to launch on June 28 with the goal of bridging the gap \u201cbetween the existing capabilities of blockchain and the needs of users, developers, and enterprises,\u201d to quote SYS Labs\u2019 CEO Jagdeep Sidhu. It\u2019s yet another example of a project distinct from Bitcoin tapping into its fundamental strengths.\n\nWhat Next?\n\nAt the time of writing, the SEC is cracking down on exchanges with both Coinbase and Binance in its crosshairs. And with regulatory concerns swirling (aren\u2019t they ever?) talk has once again turned to the potential impact on bitcoin\u2019s price. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nAway from price chatter, the picks-and-forks work continues without the same fanfare (or doomsaying) that greets every price swing, and somewhere on the horizon, the fourth Bitcoin halving looms. The ramifications of the halving can be debated another day. For now, let\u2019s raise a glass to the builders and believers, the passionate army quietly but very noticeably powering Bitcoin\u2019s latest renaissance.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
