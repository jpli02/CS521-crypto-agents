        "title": "Bitcoin Price Could Get As Low As $9,000, Asserts Pundit Who Correctly Predicted BTC\u2019s Top - ZyCrypto",
        "content": "Advertisement\n\nBitcoin continued to trend range bound on Saturday, riling investors who had to contend with lacklustre price volatility in the past 14 months. At press time, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $16,966 after a 1.11% increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Its biggest rival, Ethereum, also traded sluggishly at $1263- a level it has been toying at for the past two days.\n\nBTCUSD Chart by TradingView\n\nUnlike the past year, where a clique of high net-worth investors like Tim Draper and Ark Invest CEO Cathie woods made extremely optimistic calls for Bitcoin, it has increasingly become harder for investors to predict where crypto prices may be going as 2023 unravels. However, some sceptics are convinced that Bitcoin will plunge lower before the curve can flatten out in the coming days.\n\nFor instance, Gareth Soloway, the chief market strategist of InTheMoneyStocks, believes there is more room for Bitcoin to the downside. Speaking to Kitco News earlier yesterday, the pundit who correctly predicted Bitcoin\u2019s 2021 top, noted that Bitcoin could plunge to $9,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still looking at eventually $12,000 to $13,000 in a short-term target. I do believe it will go lower than that and pierce $10,000 and could go as low as $9,000 before all this is over.\u201d Soloway told Kitco\u2019s, David Lin.\n\nAccording to him, the Bitcoin chart was in the process of forming a \u201cbear flag pattern\u201d which, if validated, could see its price drop to the said level. He, however, stated that BTC was likely to see a minor rally in the near term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll we have to do is take out $17,000, and I actually think we are going to get a short-term rally to about $18,400. So actually, I\u2019m very short-term bullish, but you can\u2019t ignore the bigger pattern here, which is still bearish.\u201d\n\nSoloway\u2019s predictions come even as the FTX debacle hammers the markets. In the past two months, firms linked to Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s crypto empire have been folding, crushing investors\u2019 risk appetite. To Soloway, however, whereas \u201cthere is still some flushing to do\u201d, there was no doubt that all this was getting closer to ending.\n\n\u201cWe are also getting close to potential regulation, which I think will be a huge asset for bitcoin and crypto as that will be an avenue for big money to start dabbling in crypto again,\u201d he went on.\n\nPreviously, Soloway has called for Bitcoin at $500,000 in the long term as clear regulations for the crypto sector are passed, and adoption picks up. Since tapping an all-time high of $68,789 in November 2021, Bitcoin\u2019s price has fallen over 75%, making it the fourth largest wipe-out of all time in the asset\u2019s history."

        "title": "Here's My 2023 Prediction for Bitcoin, and It May Not Be What You Think - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "It probably feels like forever, but just over a year ago, Bitcoin (BTC 2.61%) hit an all-time high just shy of $70,000. Since then, the world's first and most valuable cryptocurrency has dropped about 75% and finished 2022 posting a 65% loss.\n\nAlthough corrections are more than normal after meteoric rises -- like the one Bitcoin went on when it hit its previous all-time high -- 2022's decline was exacerbated by a series of events such as bankruptcies and scandals that rattled investor confidence. Subsequently, Bitcoin tanked.\n\nI know we could all use some reason for optimism in 2023, but I would prefer to be realistic at the same time. Personally, I am hopeful Bitcoin will treat investors much better this year -- especially if they take advantage of today's cheap prices.\n\n2023: The year before the next Bitcoin halving\n\nViewed as the bell cow of crypto because of its high value relative to the rest of the industry, as Bitcoin goes so go most other cryptocurrencies. And I think there's a chance Bitcoin will have a much better year in 2023 than in 2022 -- but probably not as good as in 2021.\n\nThat belief comes down to Bitcoin's price behavior at (and in between) halvings, a mechanism in the crypto's code that reduces the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. These halvings occur roughly every four years, and the next one isn't set to happen until sometime in May 2024.\n\nIn the past, Bitcoin typically hit a bottom when the next halving was roughly a year and a half out. So with May 2024 less than 18 months away, that makes buying today extremely attractive since we have likely reached a bottom, and further risk looks to be minimal.\n\nBut of more importance is what Bitcoin does leading up to the halving. On average, Bitcoin's price is usually 50% of its previous all-time high when the next halving arrives. If it follows this pattern again, that would mean Bitcoin should be near $34,000 by May 2024.\n\nNow that's 2024. But I believe 2023 will be a year in which Bitcoin builds momentum to get closer to that $40,000 mark. By no means will this be a smooth ascension, though. The current backdrop of factors in the economy such as rising interest rates and persistent inflation will likely cause risk-on assets like Bitcoin to remain highly volatile.\n\nThe future won't necessarily unfold like it has in the past, but until proved wrong, I will remain a believer in the data.\n\nAs for a possible price target in 2023, I'm slightly hesitant to provide a specific number Bitcoin could reach, but as we get closer to the next halving, the data suggest that it could make some modest gains.\n\nEspecially when considering that after Bitcoin has a negative year, it averages a 70% return and has never posted a decline in consecutive years. If Bitcoin were to put in a 70% return in 2023, that would put its price at about $28,000.\n\nA word of caution\n\nAlthough predictions and speculation are common, and sometimes a little fun, we shouldn't use this as a reason to try to time the market. Rather, these data should be used to promote the profitability of long-term investing.\n\nMore so than any other asset in history, Bitcoin rewards those investors who keep the longest time frame. And with the recent price collapse of 2022, that strategy shouldn't change.\n\nHere's to hoping Bitcoin holders have a better year than 2022, and that 2023 is just the beginning for the crypto to reach a new all-time high in the coming years."

        "content": "Is Bitcoin or gold the better investment? Opinions vary widely, with billionaire crypto fan Mark Cuban favoring Bitcoin\u2014and slamming gold\u2014and Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff going the other way.\n\nNassim Nicholas Taleb has some thoughts too. This week the author of the 2010 New York Times bestseller The Black Swan\u2014among the few who foresaw the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis\u2014weighed in on the debate in an interview with the French weekly L\u2019Express.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Bitcoin, which has fallen more than 60% since the start of 2022, fails to impress him.\n\n\u201cTechnology comes and goes\u201d\n\nOne problem with Bitcoin, he said, is that \u201cwe are not sure of the interests, mentalities, and preferences of future generations. Technology comes and goes; gold stays, at least physically. Once neglected for a brief period, Bitcoin would necessarily collapse.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, \u201cit cannot be expected that an entry on a register that requires active maintenance by interested and motivated people\u2014this is how Bitcoin works\u2014will retain its physical properties, a condition for monetary value, for any period of time.\u201d\n\nAsked about the origins of the \u201ccraze for cryptocurrencies,\u201d he pointed to the low interest rates of the past 15 years.\n\n\u201cLowering rates creates asset bubbles without necessarily helping the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cCapital no longer costs anything; risk-free returns on investment become too low, even negative, pushing people into speculation. We lose our sense of what a long-term investment is. It is the end of real finance.\u201d\n\nOne of the results, he argued, was \u201cmalignant tumors like Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\n\nTaleb isn\u2019t alone in noting the effects of what\u2019s been dubbed the \u201ceverything bubble\u201d\u2014created by years of loose monetary policies from the Fed and other central banks following the Great Financial Crisis. As Fortune reported this week, the easy money era was filled with bulls\u2014from crypto experts to hedge fund managers to economists and investment banks\u2014who believed the good times would never end.\n\nInterestingly, Taleb was supportive of Bitcoin early on. At the time, as he explained to L\u2019Express, he was critical of then Fed Chair Ben Bernanke.\n\nBernanke, he said, did not see the structural risks of the system before the 2008 crisis, and overreacted afterward: \u201cInstead of correcting debt and mitigating hidden risks, he covered them with a monetary policy that was only supposed to be transitory. I wrongly thought Bitcoin would be a bulwark against the distortions of this monetary policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cManipulators and scammers\u201d\n\nTaleb also warned that \u201cthe crypto universe attracts manipulators and scammers.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s certainly not alone there.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at the a16z crypto Founder Summit in late November: \u201cWe have to kind of come to terms as an industry with the fact that, I think our industry is attracting a disproportionate share of fraudsters and scammers. And that\u2019s really unfortunate. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s representative of the whole industry.\u201d\n\n(Armstrong added it was \u201cbaffling\u201d to him why FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried wasn\u2019t already in custody\u2014a few weeks later, he was.)\n\nTaleb tweeted this week that he\u2019s been trolled and smeared for his crypto criticism, but that such attacks have been offset by the \u201cmany thank-you messages for saving young people from Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe shared a message in which a Twitter user said he almost bought Bitcoin but then started following Taleb\u2019s thinking on it, writing, \u201cI got why crypto is crap in theory. Then it went bust in practice. NNT saved my dad\u2019s hard earned money.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many Bitcoin bulls remain bullish. ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently reiterated her prediction that Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2030\u2014it\u2019s now just below $17,000. She also argued Bankman-Fried didn\u2019t like \u201ctransparent and decentralized\u201d Bitcoin \u201cbecause he couldn\u2019t control it,\u201d saying the FTX fiasco was caused by \u201copaque centralized players.\u201d\n\nAs for Cuban, he said on Bill Maher\u2019s Club Random podcast last month, \u201cI want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more.\u201d"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Sango Coin and the Central African Republic - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "In the spring of 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt Bitcoin (BTC) as a legal tender.\n\nAs the second country globally to recognize Bitcoin in such a fashion, the CAR followed in El Salvador\u2019s footsteps. El Salvador has since boasted surging tourism numbers, a resilient economy and a healthy amount of free PR since allowing its citizens to make everyday purchases with the seminal cryptocurrency.\n\nThe CAR, a substantially less economically developed economy than its Central American counterpart, would hope to emulate El Salvador\u2019s success. Despite the nation\u2019s vast natural resource wealth, the CAR is plagued by economic mismanagement, meager private and foreign investment, and systemic governmental issues.\n\nIt is one of the poorest countries on the poorest continent in the world, ranking right at the bottom of the World Bank\u2019s Human Development Index. To make matters worse, up to 85% of the country\u2019s exports are kept in French treasuries, while its currency of choice, the CFA franc, is heavily biased toward economic development in France. Consequently, tapping into a neutral, open-source and censorship-resistant monetary system such as Bitcoin could not only benefit but emancipate the country.\n\nPresident Bitcoiners\n\nSimilar to El Salvador, the CAR law would make Bitcoin \u201cofficial money.\u201d Naturally, this decision was lauded by Bitcoin advocates the world over. Plus, it appeared that CAR President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, a mathematician and Bitcoin supporter on social media, was inclined to support the adoption of the unique cryptocurrency. The pro-Bitcoin tweets smack of El Salvador\u2019s laser-eyed president, Nayib Bukele.\n\nMathematics is the #language of the Universe.#Bitcoin is universal money. \u2014 Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra (@FA_Touadera) April 27, 2022\n\nHowever, celebration and support for the country among the Bitcoin community were short-lived as, despite formal visits by Bitcoin-only proponents \u2014 including Galoy Money \u2014 the country began its own token project. Just days after the Bitcoin law came into effect, the country surprised the crypto community by announcing the creation of a crypto token called Sango. The population of 5 million would also benefit from a \u201ccrypto hub\u201d in the capital, Bangui.\n\nA francophone contingent of established Bitcoiners visit the CAR in May. Source: Twitter\n\nCointelegraph sat down in Senegal, West Africa with Mamadou Moustapha Ly, the Central African technician who oversaw the development of Sango Coin, to ask about the project\u2019s development. A payments expert, Ly also runs the fintech startup Kete Cash. Ly shed light on the creation of what he called a \u201ctoken, not a currency,\u201d labeled Sango. Sango is the token that would accompany the country\u2019s plans to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nCointelegraph speaks to Ly in Senegal.\n\nFirst, Ly stressed that the Bitcoin-as-legal-tender law clearly states that the country will adopt Bitcoin. There is no mention of other cryptocurrencies or even Sango Coin. He painted a clear divide between Sango and Bitcoin:\n\n\u201cThe law states that the digital currency that is legal tender is Bitcoin. We recognize this as our official currency. [...] Sango coin is a project for the Central African Republic state.\u201d\n\nSango Coin offers attractive incentives to foreign investors, including citizenship by investment and eventually a CAR passport, as well as governance advantages. In a sense, buying Sango is a way of buying residency in the country, without touching government-issued fiat currencies.\n\nA token effort\n\nBut why was this necessary? El Salvador did not create a new token to support its Bitcoin adoption efforts \u2014 so, why would the CAR?\n\nTo compare the two country\u2019s Bitcoin adoption strategies, both countries announced Bitcoin as a legal tender. From that point onward, they diverge. In El Salvador, foreigners could initially buy residency with an investment of 3 BTC, although it was then rescinded. In the CAR, \u201ce-residency can be obtained [...] by locking a fixed collateral of SANGO Coins in the amount of 6000$ for a period of 3 years.\u201d Plus, foreign investors can directly access the country\u2019s strategic resources through the use of the crypto token, Ly explained.\n\nTo gain exposure to El Salvador\u2019s rapid development without touching Bitcoin, the Central American country teed up volcano bonds. The volcano or Bitcoin bonds support the creation of a \u201cBitcoin City\u201d and are backstopped by the government. In contrast, Sango is a cryptocurrency built on a blockchain \u201cbacked by Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe now-defunct Luna Classic (LUNC) token was the last time a token used Bitcoin as its treasury. The token\u2019s meltdown wiped billions of dollars from the crypto total market cap and dented confidence in the industry. So, why create a token? Why build a system liable to hacking or attack from malicious actors? And why do so despite the Bitcoin contingent\u2019s best interest to steer a Bitcoin-only path?\n\nLy explained that Sango is a \u201cgovernment project.\u201d Money raised through the sale of Sango Coin will be used to buy Bitcoin, which can then be used to acquire the materials necessary for development projects, as well as to pay for labor and other expenses.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note the country\u2019s dire financial situation. Reports continue to indicate that civil servants and government salaries are paid by its former colonizer, France, while the country is labeled a \u201crepressed\u201d economy according to the Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2022 Index of Economic Freedom.\n\nWhile Bitcoin advocates hail Bitcoin adoption as a panacea to most modern-day problems, in the CAR, the priorities are clean water, security, education then maybe internet connectivity. With these motivations, the country needs investment \u2014 fast.\n\nThe African franc.\n\nTo this point, Ly noted that the Central African Republic\u2019s high level of external debt makes it difficult for the country to access traditional forms of financing. Sango Coin could be that alternative source of funding. Indeed, one could infer that the quick liquidity provided by Sango is a way of jumpstarting much-needed foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country.\n\nRelated: \u2018We don\u2019t like our money\u2019: The story of the CFA and Bitcoin in Africa\n\nIn addition, the use of a crypto token allows for greater flexibility and speed in conducting financial transactions, as well as reducing the risk of fraud, he commented. In a sense, the use of Sango could sidestep the bureaucracy and slow administrative practices for which Central African governments are known. Plus, it could allow investment flows into the country without touching dollars or the local currency.\n\nWhen asked why the Central African Republic did not simply use Bitcoin or the superfast Lightning Network for these purposes, Ly reiterated that Sango Coin is intended to serve as a token associated with the government project: \u201cIt\u2019s not a general-purpose currency.\u201d\n\nSango could allow for greater control over the flow of funds, therefore reducing the risk of capital flight. In addition, the World Bank points out that the country will not be able to develop its human capital without strengthening domestic revenue mobilization sustainably. Sango could be the quickest path to more robust revenues.\n\nBitcoin on the ground\n\nPaco De La India, known as \u201cRun with Bitcoin,\u201d recently spent two weeks traveling in the CAR in the hopes of spending Bitcoin and interacting with Bitcoin people. He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cThere was no not even a single business that accepted Bitcoin. I gave my guide a tip in Bitcoin. I paid my host in Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nWith those small successes aside, Paco told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin adoption on the ground was minimal. In a country where less than a quarter of the country has access to the internet \u2014 a basic requirement to use \u201cmagic internet money\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\nAs for the creation of Sango Coin, Paco suggested there could be external forces at play. The CAR is tremendously resource-rich, so why couldn\u2019t a French state-run project meddle with the creation of the token? he questioned. The token was indeed created quickly after state visits to one of the world\u2019s crypto hubs, Dubai.\n\nLy explained that foreign influences did have an effect on the decision-making process:\n\n\u201cThe idea for Sango Coin came from a private partner based in Dubai who discussed it with the Head of State.\u201d\n\nAnd a deal was struck with foreign investors, but there was no suggestion that the former colonial power may be using Sango Coin to control resources. It might simply be the quickest way to raise capital and, as Ly suggested, use this capital to buy Bitcoin and build the country\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nUltimately, Bitcoin adoption and the creation of Sango appear to be a ploy to inject much-needed FDI into the country and enhance the country\u2019s standing globally. However, the creation of this token may shun interest from the wider Bitcoin community, arguably the frontline investors to places and jurisdictions that announce their plans for Bitcoin."

        "title": "Why MicroStrategy is Betting the Farm on Bitcoin - Bitcoin Market Journal",
        "content": "\u201cBitcoin is appreciating money. Bonds are crumbling credit. Build your future on a firm foundation.\u201d \u2013 Michael Saylor, CEO & Co-founder MicroStrategy\n\nIn November 2023, the software company MicroStrategy made a big gamble: it bought over 16,000 bitcoin, spending nearly $600 million.\n\nThen it threw them onto the pile of bitcoin it had been stockpiling, for a total of 175,000 bitcoin worth over $5 billion. This puts them on the Top 10 list of bitcoin holders, along with Binance, the U.S. government, and Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nThe reality is that MicroStrategy\u2019s Michael Saylor is betting the farm on BTC rather than taking a more conservative approach (such as our money-making blockchain investor portfolio).\n\nSo far, Saylor appears correct, as bitcoin has appreciated 221% since MicroStrategy adopted its bitcoin strategy, while bonds have diminished by 22%. But our take is that if you want exposure to bitcoin, it\u2019s simpler to just buy bitcoin rather than investing in MicroStrategy stock ($MSTR).\n\nWhat Does MicroStrategy Do?\n\nSince all the MicroStrategy news headlines are about bitcoin, it can be hard to remember that it\u2019s a business.\n\nMicroStrategy creates business intelligence software that helps businesses analyze and visualize large amounts of complex data. Competitor products would be Tableau, Microsoft Power BI, or Qlik.\n\nThe company has continuously innovated its products, making developing applications that tie into your data easier, providing extensive support for mobile users, and adding advanced AI capabilities.\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s revenues have gradually declined over the past decade, though fortunes have improved somewhat over the past few years:\n\nMeanwhile, MicroStrategy\u2019s stock ($MSTR) has increased by over 200% since Saylor started stockpiling bitcoin in 2020. In fact, the stock has increased even faster than the price of bitcoin, making it an attractive option for investors who can\u2019t invest in bitcoin directly.\n\nOn the other hand, MicroStrategy\u2019s huge bitcoin stash makes the stock extremely volatile, as if you were buying bitcoin directly. Note its correlation with the price of BTC:\n\nSaylor\u2019s fixation on bitcoin has thrown the company\u2019s economics out of whack: in our view, when you buy $MSTR stock, you\u2019re not buying the business, you\u2019re buying bitcoin.\n\nThis begs the question: why not just buy bitcoin directly?\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s Bitcoin Strategy\n\nBy foraying into bitcoin on such a massive scale, MicroStrategy is not merely adopting a new corporate investing strategy. The company is challenging the conventional norms that have guided other publicly traded companies for over a century.\n\nHowever, this does pose considerable challenges related to regulatory compliance, stakeholder communications, and market optics.\n\nTo adequately address these issues, MicroStrategy has created a multi-pronged BTC strategy with the following core considerations:\n\nNarrative\n\nSwitching from traditional assets to crypto presents a giant leap that could alienate a significant section of investors and raise doubts in the minds of employees and other stakeholders.\n\nAny organization mulling this move must figure out a compelling narrative to present. In a market with limited avenues for exposure to BTC, MicroStrategy is positioning itself as a vehicle for investors interested in indirect exposure to crypto.\n\nAnd this strategy is working instead nicely so far. In 2023, while BTC gained 160%, MicroStrategy stocks surged by more than 350%.\n\nAccounting and Reporting\n\nHighly volatile crypto assets like BTC present significant challenges related to corporate accounting and disclosure of financial reports.\n\nFor instance, crypto investments have an elevated risk of impermanent loss. To accurately reflect this in financial reports, MicroStrategy will have to conduct more frequent impairment testing, a financial accounting process used to assess whether the carrying value of an asset on a company\u2019s balance sheet exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nThe constantly shifting valuation of BTC also impacts your ability to present an accurate estimation of market risks, future earnings, liquidity, quarterly results, and more.\n\nRisk Management\n\nCryptocurrency transactions are irreversible and almost anonymous. These strengths can pose major problems from a corporate investment perspective as they increase the risk of theft, fraud, and losses due to inadvertent transactions.\n\nCustody and Storage\n\nGiven the high risk of theft associated with \u201chot\u201d wallets, MicroStrategy considers \u201ccold\u201d wallets more appropriate for large-scale crypto holdings. They are also more convenient for risk disclosures.\n\nThe company relies on US-based qualified custodians to act as fiduciaries under relevant banking regulations. Multiple custodial accounts can offer some diversification. For large BTC transactions, MicroStrategy prefers relying on specialized brokers.\n\nMicroStrategy BTC Holdings vs Other Treasuries\n\nAs of January 2024, MicroStrategy owned 189,150 BTC, valued at over $8.4 billion. This represents 0.901% of the total BTC supply of 21 million coins. Here is how that stacks up against various other BTC treasuries.\n\nVs. Other Public Companies\n\nAmong public companies that own BTC, MicroStrategy is miles ahead of the rest of the chasing pack. The next biggest treasury on the list belongs to Marathon Digital Holdings, with 14,025 BTC worth $624 million. Honestly, that\u2019s not even close to being in the same league.\n\nThe total value of BTC held by public companies is around $12.3 billion, or 276,336. MicroStrategy currently holds more than 68% of the total BTC under the ownership of publicly traded companies.\n\nVs. Governments\n\nSovereign nations around the globe own a combined total of at least $20.1 billion, or 451,968BTC in their treasuries. That represents 1.316% of the entire supply of BTC.\n\nIf MicroStrategy were a country, it would rank third on the largest government-owned BTC treasuries list. The company is only behind the USA ($9.22 billion) and China ($8.63) billion in its bitcoin holdings.\n\nGovernments aren\u2019t investing in bitcoin, though. Most of the government-held bitcoin has been confiscated from criminal actors. The world\u2019s governments have no interest in the price movement of bitcoin.\n\nVs. Private Companies\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy, Mt Gox, the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange, had bitcoin reserves of around 200,000 BTC worth $8.9 billion. Since most of it will be paid out to its creditors, that leaves Block as one as the next biggest privately-owned stash of BTC.\n\nThe blockchain software services company reportedly owns over 140,000 BTC, worth an estimated $6.2 billion at current rates. Other notable treasuries belong to entities like Tether Holdings ($2.44 billion), Tezos Foundation ($779 million), and Stone Ridge ($445 million).\n\nVs. ETFs\n\nOnly Grayscale Bitcoin Trust owns a bigger treasury than MicroStrategy among bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Not surprising, given that the purpose of an ETF is to purchase the asset represented by the ETF in hopes of making a profit for the fund holders. Grayscale has over 643,000 BTC valued at $28 billion, or 3.065% of the total supply.\n\nThe other significant ETFs all have smaller BTC holdings than MicroStrategy: Coinshares/XBT Provider ($2.1 billion), Purpose Bitcoin ($1.12 billion), and 3iQ Coinshares Bitcoin ($945 million) are the big ones.\n\nLearning From History\n\nSaylor is like a modern-day Scrooge McDuck, rolling around in his giant pile of bitcoin.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with saving cash for a rainy day, even a lot of it. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook hold billions in cash and marketable securities, which gives them options when they need to acquire a competitor or move quickly into a new market.\n\nBut the historical performance of hoarding behavior is mixed, at best. For example:\n\nApple Hoarding Gold : Steve Jobs believed gold was the ultimate hedge against inflation. (Sound familiar?) So, Apple kept a vast gold reserve for much of the 1970s and 1980s. The company sold off most of its gold in the 1990s and was later criticized for not investing that money back into the business.\n\n: Steve Jobs believed gold was the ultimate hedge against inflation.

Coca-Cola Hoarding Sugar : For much of the 20th century, Coca-Cola kept a strategic supply to protect its supply chain from sugar shortages and unexpected price increases. The practice continued until the late 2000s when sugar markets became more stable and globalized.\n\n: For much of the 20th century, Coca-Cola kept a strategic supply to protect its supply chain from sugar shortages and unexpected price increases.

Oil is one of Iran\u2019s most valuable assets, so the country keeps enormous oil reserves, which allows it economic and political leverage. But it brings the threat of fluctuating oil prices and international sanctions.\n\n: An excellent example of resource stockpiling on a national scale.

De Beers Hoarding Diamonds: When the company monopolized diamonds, they kept a stockpile of the precious gems to manipulate prices and maintain market dominance. Thankfully, better regulations and smarter consumers have forced De Beers to diversify their holdings.\n\nSometimes, hoarding works for a while. However, we believe that resources are usually better spent on growing the business, especially in the fast-moving technology industry. Long-term, Scrooge McDuck would probably be better off investing in his nephew\u2019s new ideas.\n\nMicroStrategy BTC Purchases Over Time\n\nMicroStrategy\u2019s three biggest BTC purchases were all made in their first year of BTC investing \u2013 starting in August 2020. By the end of the year, the company had amassed a BTC treasury valued at $1.125 billion.\n\nIn 2021, MicroStrategy made 14 different BTC purchases. The biggest of these was a $1.02 billion transaction on February 24. By the end of 2021, the company's BTC reserves had tripled to $3.75 billion.\n\nThe activity was relatively muted in 2022, as MicroStrategy only added around $250 million to its BTC reserves over the entire year. However, things have accelerated in 2023, with seven major purchases pushing its reserves close to $6 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy Financial Performance\n\nWhile assessing MicroStrategy\u2019s (MSTR) financial performance, it is essential to factor in the actual impact of impairment charges/impermanent losses.\n\nThe company's operating revenues have remained relatively stagnant since 2017, staying close to the $500 million line.\n\nHowever, since its BTC investment strategy began, operating income has fallen drastically due to the reporting of impairment losses.\n\nIn 2021 and 2022, the company reported net income losses to $535 million and $1.46 billion, despite posting a gross profit of close to $400 million in both years.\n\nThis gives a somewhat inaccurate impression of the company's current performance, especially since it plans to hold BTC long-term. The numbers could bounce back in the future when the BTC prices rise.\n\nYou can see this disparity in the performance of the $MSTR stock. From a price of $166 in early January 2023, the stock had risen to $665 by the end of the year, indicating a 1Y price performance of +400. On December 29, it had a P/E ratio of 489.44.\n\nMicroStrategy Vs Competitors\n\nThe main competitors of MicroStrategy in the prepackaged software industry niche include Guidewire Software (GWRE), SS&C Technologies (SSNC), Blackbaud (BLKB), Instructure (INST), Commvault Systems (CVLT), ACI Worldwide (ACIW), Tyler Technologies (TYL), Progress Software (PRGS), Sapiens International (SPNS), and ANSYS (ANSS).\n\nLet us look closely at some of these competitors for a fair idea of MicroStrategy\u2019s overall performance.\n\nGuidewire Software (GWRE)\n\nDespite a slightly lower market cap of $8.75 billion, GWRE boasts a better revenue than MSTR. The reported revenues of $905 million are more than double the average reported by MSRT in recent years. However, the 1Y price performance is only +70, and the P/E ratio is -125.59.\n\nInstructure (INST)\n\nThe market cap of this firm is $3.74 billion, or around one-third of MSTR. Instructure also reported comparable revenues of $475.19 million in 2023. Despite that, the demand for the stock remains rather tepid, with a 1Y price performance of +10.9%. The P/E ratio is likewise in the negative at -108.29.\n\nTyler Technologies (TYL)\n\nTYL is a more prominent company than MSTR, with a market cap of $17.19 billion. It also reported nearly 5x the latter's revenues at $1.85 billion. The 1Y price performance is positive at +26.6%. and the P/E ratio is also quite good at 110.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nFrom a cursory glance at the competition, it is pretty clear that MicroStrategy stock is overperforming despite relatively lackluster financials and revenue reports. The investor interest generated by the company\u2019s exposure to BTC is probably the only reason for its highly inflated P/E ratio.\n\nProblems with the SEC\n\nEven before its pivot to BTC, MicroStrategy has had past run-ins with the SEC. In 2000, the SEC filed fraud charges against the company for allegedly overstating its revenues and earnings for the preceding two years.\n\nDespite suffering losses between 1997 and 2000, MicroStrategy was alleged to have reported material gains in the run-up to its IPO in 1998. Immediately after the civil accounting fraud charges were filed, MicroStrategy reached a settlement deal with the SEC.\n\nThe company agreed to pay a fine of $11 million to settle cases. The penalties were paid by three top executives at the firm, including current CEO Michael Saylor, who paid $8.3 million. However, the settlement did not involve any admission of wrongdoing by MicroStrategy.\n\nAs part of the deal, MicroStrategy also agreed to restate financial results for 1998 and 1999. The company stock dropped 60% of its value within a day due to the fraud charges. From a peak of $333, it finally bottomed out at $33.\n\nThe Risk of Betting the Business on Bitcoin\n\nIn our investing approach, we recognize that bitcoin is risky: a roller-coaster. That\u2019s why we hedge that risk by investing primarily in common stocks and bonds, with just a portion of our portfolio allocated to bitcoin:\n\nYou\u2019ve got to wonder why Saylor doesn\u2019t do the same. Why not hedge the risk of bitcoin with other investments \u2013 even gold?\n\nBy putting everything into bitcoin, he\u2019s doing the thing we constantly warn you about. We don\u2019t bet the farm on bitcoin.\n\nOnly in Saylor\u2019s case, he\u2019s betting the business on bitcoin.\n\nTrue, it\u2019s unlikely that bitcoin will go to zero. True, it\u2019s possible that his bitcoin investment could be 10x.\n\nAnd then what? Buy more bitcoin?\n\nInvestor Takeaway: Lots of Risk, Uncertain Reward\n\nUltimately, the purpose of a business is to generate new value for the world. If MicroStrategy is buying bitcoin without reinvesting it, investors should ask what the business really does. Is it a bitcoin holding company with a bit of software business?\n\nIf so, where is the value in that?\n\nMake no mistake: we\u2019re bitcoin believers. More importantly, we\u2019re believers in a new financial system. Here, MicroStrategy has enormous potential: it could use its considerable expertise to develop new financial software products or services that bring the world into the crypto age.\n\nBut sitting on top of a $5 billion bitcoin stash subjects the company to wild market uncertainty. It puts MicroStrategy on the bitcoin roller coaster. Lots of risk, with uncertain reward.\n\nFor investors who want to invest in bitcoin, our solution is simple: invest in bitcoin. Not MicroStrategy."
