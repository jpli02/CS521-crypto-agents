        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nwatch now\n\nBitcoin touched a 13-month high on Thursday as the drumbeat for institutional bitcoin demand grew louder following comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. The cryptocurrency ended the day flat at $30,302.03, according to Coin Metrics. Early in the morning, it climbed to about $31,450, reaching its highest level since June 2022. It gave back those gains, however, after better-than-expected U.S. jobs data increased investor worries about path of interest rates. The earlier move was in contrast to both weaker stock prices and rising yields \u2014 the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note later climbed above 4% to a 16-year high. Additionally, the minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting, released Wednesday, showed that most officials would support more rate increases ahead. Cryptocurrency liquidity has been low for several months, continuing to exaggerate both up and down moves.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back Thursday following better-than-expected U.S. jobs data.\n\n\"There is still a weight on the price,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and author of the \"Crypto is Macro Now\" newsletter. \"We have often over the past few weeks seen selling resistance at around $31,000. That will eventually be broken, but meanwhile traditional markets seem to be entering a more risk-off mood \u2013 we can't yet assume that bitcoin will just shrug that off.\" Sentiment among traders was high though, after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink gave bitcoin perhaps its biggest ever endorsement from a major institutional player. Speaking on Fox Business News on Wednesday, Fink called bitcoin \"an international asset\" and said it's \"not based on any one currency so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative.\" Bitcoin has steadily climbed since June 15, when BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, first filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The number of coins held by institutions through trusts, ETFs and funds has spiked since then, reaching its highest level in more than a year, according to CryptoQuant, and bitcoin open interest is back to pre-FTX levels."

        "title": "Bitcoin loses US$30,000 peg, Ether falls as risk-off sentiment spreads to cryptocurrencies - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell below the US$30,000 support line in Friday morning trading in Asia as traders took profits amid worries about interest rate hikes in U.S. markets that drove investors into so-called risk-off mode, which pulled equities lower. Ether fell along with most other top 10 non-stablecoin tokens. Solana dodged the bearish sentiment to jump more than 6%. Despite the declines, the cryptocurrency Fear & Greed Index stands in the Greed territory at 56, as institutional interest in Bitcoin looks solid.\n\nLosing ground\n\nBitcoin fell 1.88% over the last 24 hours to US$29,919 at 07:20 a.m. in Hong Kong to post a loss of 1.68% for the past seven days, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency reached US$31,399 on Thursday night, the highest in 13 months.\n\n\u201cWith strong economic data in the US, good earning expectations and employment data in the private sector, investors are seeing increasing chances of further rate hikes; bond yields rose while equity indexes fell sharply,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of APAC business development at Belgium-based crypto market-maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThe broad sell-off in risk assets undoubtedly affected crypto traders\u2019 sentiment and new highs were seen as a profit-taking opportunity, rather than a chance to go long and hope for even higher prices,\u201d d\u2019Anethan said.\n\nLarge financial institutions show increasing interest in Bitcoin, according to the Bitcoin Monthly June 2023 Report by asset manager Ark Invest on Thursday, which highlighted the balance of Bitcoin held on over-the-counter (OTC) desks, a proxy for institutional activity, hitting a one-year high in late June.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the quarter, the OTC Bitcoin balance had increased by 60% sequentially,\u201d Ark Invest wrote in the report, which suggests \u201cinstitutions and other large capital allocators are focused increasingly on Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nEther fell 3.13% to US$1,851, leaving it flat for the week. The token reached a high of US$1,956 on Thursday evening, but soon lost ground as investors took profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies also logged losses in the past 24 hours, with the exception of Solana\u2019s SOL and Tron\u2019s TRX.\n\nSolana jumped 6.48% to US$20.12, moving up 12.52% for the week. The token breached the US$20 resistance level on Thursday evening for the first time since June 7 as sentiment received a boost from a partnership between Coca-Cola Serbia and Solana\u2019s non-fungible token (NFT) platform SolSea. The two will launch Coca-Cola brand NFTs at the Exit Festival in Serbia from July 6 to 9.\n\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap fell 1.45% to US$1.17 trillion in the last 24 hours, while crypto trading volume rose 37.62% to US$43.26 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data.\n\nForkast 500 NFT index dips\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.38% in the 24 hours to 11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong to 2,774.37, down 2.73% for the week. The two Forkast indexes measuring the performance of Solana and Cardano NFT markets logged increases.\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) led collections by trading volumes, which rose 19.85% to US$3.49 million. Mutant Ape Yach Club (MAYC) and Azuki ranked second and third.\n\n\u201cThe big NFT collections who saw large decreases in their floor prices have regained some footing, and now are bouncing up or down around 5% instead of the massive double-digit swings they were seeing earlier this week and last week,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\n\nThe floor price of BAYC edged up 0.6% in the past 24 hours to 30.95 ETH (US$57,477), according to data from CoinGecko, while MAYC and Azuki dipped 1.5% and 3.2% over the same period. However, the three tokens are still holding two-digit losses for the past seven days.\n\nDespite the low price opportunities, a lack of liquidity is keeping investors away from the market, according to Petscher, who said \u201ctraders are openly discussing having no liquidity and no plans to take advantage of historically low prices across blockchains.\u201d\n\nBlur, the leading NFT marketplace, launched its version 2 trading platform on Thursday, which introduced a 50% cut in gas fees and a new \u201ctrait bidding\u201d feature, which allows traders to bid on specific NFT traits rather than collections and receive Blur reward points.\n\nHowever, the update doesn\u2019t appear to be attracting traders. According to data from blockchain aggregator DefiLlama, the total value locked on Blur was US$134.96 million on Friday, down from 155.68 million on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also talk of ETH being withdrawn from Blur\u2019s ETH pool as some of the biggest points farmers are upset with the ongoing Season 2 of farming,\u201d said Petscher. Blur announced its Season 2 of farming in February and said it would distribute over 300 million Blur tokens as rewards for bidding, listing, lending and other activities in the marketplaces.\n\nGood news is bad news (again) for U.S. equities\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded lower as of 14:00 p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data from CNN. The three major U.S. indexes also fell in the regular Thursday session.\n\nMost main Stock indexes across Asia also tumbled on Friday, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all sliding. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index edged up.\n\nEconomic indicators out in the U.S. overnight showed increases in private sector jobs and pay, according to the ADP National Employment Report published. The payroll increase is more than double the analysts\u2019 expectation of 228,000, Reuters reported on Thursday, despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary tightening campaign.\n\nThe U.S. services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to 53.9 in June, according to the Institute for Supply Management on Thursday, which beats Reuters\u2019 projection of 51. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, below 50 a contraction.\n\nThe data added to concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue its campaign of raising rates and holding them higher for longer periods to tackle inflation. The Fed meets on July 26 to make its next decision on interest rates, after leaving them unchanged in June at between 5% and 5.25%.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 92.4% chance for a 25-basis-point rate increase, up from 88.7% on Thursday. The likelihood the Fed won\u2019t increase is now at just 7.6%.\n\nInvestors are now waiting for the U.S. government\u2019s employment report on Friday, with economists polled by the Wall Street Journal projecting the U.S. economy added 240,000 jobs in June, down from 339,000 in May.\n\n(Updates with NFT and equity sections.)"
