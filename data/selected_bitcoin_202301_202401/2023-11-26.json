        "content": "Michael Saylor\u2019s Microstrategy Stock Price Reaches Two-Year-High, Boosted by Bitcoin Holdings\n\nMicroStrategy, the enterprise business firm well-known for its optimistic stance on Bitcoin, witnessed a surge in its stock price, surpassing $500 on last friday, marking levels not seen since December 2021. Boasting a market capitalization of $7.33 billion, MicroStrategy's profitable approach of holding Bitcoin for the long term has yielded favorable results. Under the guidance of its founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, the company initiated the accumulation of the cryptocurrency as a safeguard against inflation starting in August 2020.\n\nMicroStrategy experienced a doubling of its stock price within a month earlier this year, with its Bitcoin investments consistently appreciating. Currently, the company's Bitcoin holdings have turned profitable, with an average purchase price of $29,803 per coin after acquiring an additional 1,045 Bitcoin. Currently, MicroStrategy possesses approximately 140,000 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $4.4 billion.\n\nDespite reporting a net loss of $143.4 million in its most recent quarterly report, MicroStrategy continued to strengthen its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring 6,067 Bitcoin for $167 million. This accumulation now represents roughly 0.75% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."

        "content": "CNBC Host Jim Cramer Is Now Bullish on Bitcoin: \u201cIf you like Bitcoin, buy Bitcoin\u201d\n\nJim Cramer, the host of CNBC's Mad Money, has reversed his opinion on Bitcoin and is now urging investors to reconsider their positions as the cryptocurrency reaches its highest value in a year and a half. Previously, Cramer had advised against investing in Bitcoin but now acknowledges that his earlier assessment was premature.\n\nBitcoin has seen a significant surge in value, surpassing $38,000 for the first time in 18 months. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency has shown a steady increase of 10%, while Ethereum has also experienced a spike of 17%, reaching its own 18-month peak.\n\nThis positive momentum is largely attributed to industry optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If approved, the ETF would allow traditional financial institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Analysts believe that such approval could result in a substantial $1 trillion boost for Bitcoin and other digital assets.\n\nDespite previously dismissing cryptocurrencies due to the crypto market collapse in May 2022 and the closure of crypto exchange FTX, Cramer now claims that he has always supported those who have long-term faith in Bitcoin. He encourages individuals to consider purchasing Bitcoin if they believe in its potential.\n\nCramer's changing stance on investments has faced criticism from the crypto and finance communities, with some suggesting that going against his advice could be a prudent financial strategy. An inverse Cramer ETF was launched to provide returns opposite of his stock picks.\n\nLet us know what you loved about this article, what could be improved, or share any other feedback by filling out this short form."
