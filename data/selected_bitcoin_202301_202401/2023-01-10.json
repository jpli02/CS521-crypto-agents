        "content": "APRIL 8: Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners, smiles as he speaks during the Bitcoin 2022 Marco Bello / Stringer /Getty Images\n\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz is still mostly upbeat about crypto in 2023.\n\n\"The outlook for crypto is not horrible, but it's not great,\" Novogratz told CNBC.\n\nThe bitcoin bull said crypto brokerage Genesis' liquidity woes are hanging over the industry.\n\nGalaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz says 2023 will be a time for the cryptocurrency industry to \"cut costs\" and \"survive this transition period\" after the collapse of FTX, along with a slew of other market meltdowns still spilling over from last year.\n\nThe bitcoin bull says the crypto outlook is \"not horrible, but it's not great,\" he told CNBC's Squawk Box on Tuesday.\n\n\"We've got regulatory headwinds that we didn't have before,\" Novogratz said. \"We've got time to heal and rebuild narrative. And so people are going to cut costs and survive this transition period.\"\n\nNovogratz comments come at a time of great uncertainty for the industry.\n\nThe nascent space has endured the fallout of its biggest players like Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, and algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD.\n\nThe uncertain fate of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the crypto conglomerate that own digital asset brokerage Genesis and asset manager Grayscale, is an overhang for the industry as well.\n\nGenesis' lending arm halted loan redemptions and originations in November due to a severe liquidity crunch. The firm and its parent company are facing accusations of fraud from Gemini cofounder Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nNovogratz says that the Gemini and DCG debacle won't involve \"a lot of selling\" for crypto markets, but it's \"just not great news.\"\n\nDCG is being investigated by US prosecutors for internal transfers between the parent company and its embattled lender, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "Bitcoin and cryptocurrency tax: Tips and guide - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency has been on a wild ride lately from soaring highs to crushing lows to the recent implosion of FTX, the world\u2019s third-largest crypto currency exchange. But one thing that hasn\u2019t changed? If you trade, sell, exchange, or get rid of cryptocurrency for a gain, you\u2019ll owe taxes on it.\n\nThat\u2019s because, tax-wise, the IRS doesn\u2019t treat cryptocurrency like cash, but as property. Similar to stocks, the value of cryptocurrency can increase or decrease over time.\n\n\u201cWith cash, if you have a $10 bill at the beginning of the year, barring slight changes for inflation or cost of living, it will still be worth $10 at the end of the year,\" said Helena Swyter, a certified public accountant and owner of Sweeter CPA in Chicago. \"But if you purchased $10 worth of cryptocurrency, it could be worth a lot more or a lot less than that in a year.\u201d\n\nThose fluctuations become gains or losses once you sell or exchange the cryptocurrency, at which point they can be taxable, and the IRS is going to want to know about them on Form 1040, your federal income tax return form.\n\nNew this year is the addition of a specific digital assets section on the 1040 form, named broadly enough to include not just cryptocurrency, but also non-fungible tokens. In this section is a question that asks: \u201cAt any time during 2022, did you receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or sell, exchange, gift, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?\u201d\n\nCredit: Getty Images (Westend61 via Getty Images)\n\nHow to track crypto transactions\n\nBecause you have to report your cryptocurrency gains and losses to the IRS, you need a good system to keep track of them. First, check with the brokerage or exchange you use to buy or sell cryptocurrency to see if it has tracking capabilities you can use or access, Swyter said. If not, use an app, tax reporting software, or a spreadsheet to track the information on your own, she said.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to track:\n\nHow much in dollars you spent to buy the cryptocurrency\n\nThe date you bought or received the cryptocurrency\n\nThe date you sold or exchanged the cryptocurrency\n\nHow much the coins were worth in dollars on the date you sold them\n\nStory continues\n\nIf you sell cryptocurrency coins for less than what you paid for them, that\u2019s a loss. You don\u2019t pay taxes on the losses. You can offset cryptocurrency capital gains with losses of up to $3,000, according to the IRS. If you have more than that amount in losses, you can carry it forward to future years.\n\n\u201cBut if you later sold cryptocurrency for more than its purchase price, that\u2019s a taxable gain,\u201d Swyter said. \u201cThis gain is taxed at short- or long-term capital gains rates, depending on how long you owned it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know the dates you bought and sold your cryptocurrency. Some cryptocurrency exchanges will send you a 1099-B or a 1099-K form near the end of January. The 1099-B shows your gains or losses from selling cryptocurrency, while the 1099-K shows your proceeds. A 1099-B is more useful for figuring out how much you owe for taxes, but not every exchange sends these out. If they do, they may only send to certain people who made many or larger transactions. So it\u2019s a good idea to keep your own records.\n\nNFT non fungible token. Credit: Getty Images (Adrian Vidal via Getty Images)\n\nHow to report crypto gains and losses\n\nTo figure out a loss or gain, look at how much you paid for the cryptocurrency \u2014 including fees \u2014 and subtract it from the selling price. If the number is negative, that\u2019s a loss. If it\u2019s positive, that\u2019s a profit.\n\nIf you owned the cryptocurrency for one year or less before you sold or exchanged it, it\u2019s taxed as a short-term gain or loss, which is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate. If you held it for a year or more before you sold or exchanged it, it\u2019s calculated as a long-term capital gain or loss.\n\nThose are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rate, based on your tax bracket.\n\nMany people\u2019s experiences with cryptocurrency is through coins they\u2019ve bought that are held in a brokerage account, Swyter said. But if you received other types of income in cryptocurrency, you need to report those, too.\n\n\u201cIf you earned interest from a cryptocurrency bank that needs to be converted to U.S. dollars when you receive it, report it the same way you would from a traditional bank,\u201d Swyter said. The same goes if someone paid you for a service in cryptocurrency, she added.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve calculated your gains and losses \u2014 and determined whether they were short- or long-term capital gains \u2014 you\u2019re ready to fill out the required tax forms.\n\nIf you\u2019re reporting both short-and long-term gains and losses, fill out tax Form 8949. After that, you should also fill out and file a regular income tax form, Form 1040 (Schedule D), which includes a space to summarize your transactions from Form 8949. If you\u2019ve done a good job with your record keeping, your work should be done.\n\nKate Rockwood is a freelance writer and editor.\n\nClick here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisions\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or Android\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube."

        "title": "The Top 7 Cryptos to Buy Before the Next Bitcoin Halving - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "As we head into a new year, 2023 is set to be the best time to look for cryptos to buy. The turbulence last year due to rate hikes and the selloff of cyclical assets such as cryptos might make it look all doom and gloom. But the bottom has historically been the best time to buy.\n\nOf course, it is difficult to predict the actual bottom, but many projects now sit well below pre-pandemic prices, with little downside risk. Moreover, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will halve its mining rewards sometime in Q1 2024. As most cryptos correlate with BTC, this halving will likely start another crypto bull run next year, continuing the historical trend.\n\nTherefore, let\u2019s\u2019 dive into the following seven cryptos to buy, as they can benefit heavily from Bitcoin\u2019s halving. I highly recommend doing your own research into these tokens, as many of them are small-cap projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nUp trend Technical graph of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in futuristic concept, BITI ETF is a Bitcoin short fund for investors betting against Bitcoin.\n\nSource: Sittipong Phokawattana / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, Bitcoin will be the biggest beneficiary of the halving. The standard deviation of BTC is lower than almost every other cryptocurrency, excluding stablecoins. Thus, if you are looking for the safest cryptos to buy, Bitcoin should always be your go-to project due to its evergreen status.\n\nI\u2019d even say it is the only crypto project worth dollar-cost averaging into, as positive returns are very likely if you choose to hold for many years. It is a tried and tested asset with a solid reputation and won\u2019t disappoint in the long run. I cannot say the same for any other asset in this article.\n\nIn the current environment, BTC is by far your best bet. There are no guarantees that the crypto market is at a bottom, and Standard Chartered analysts forecast Bitcoin could go as low as $5,000 this year. The scarier part of this scenario is that more cyclical altcoins will be hit much harder.\n\nStory continues\n\nConversely, the economy remains healthy, with the recent jobs report indicating a robust labor market. If the Fed does a U-turn in late 2023 or early 2024 and the Bitcoin halving occurs within the expected time, BTC is likely to surge. Thus, it remains the best among the cryptos to buy.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nCrypto currency etherium. ethereum coin on exchange charts. e-currency Ethereum. Ethereum price predictions\n\nSource: viktoryabov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap and should be your second option if you are looking for safer cryptos to buy. Although ETH is more volatile than BTC, it is an established project that has survived multiple crypto market cycles and outperformed Bitcoin of late.\n\nThe project is at the forefront of Web3 and blockchain development, leading the development of smart contract-based applications such as non-fungible tokens. A significant number of NFTs and Web3 projects are also being developed on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the most considerable advantage of Ethereum is that thousands of crypto projects rely on the blockchain and need ETH for gas fees. There are 744,000 ERC20 tokens on the network, generating significant demand for Ethereum.\n\nFurthermore, the network\u2019s switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus reduced ETH issuance by 88%. In the next crypto market rally, increased ETH demand and reduced issuance will likely make Ethereum trade at a much higher valuation.\n\nSticking with Bitcoin and Ethereum will give you a balanced risk-reward ratio. Thus, I recommend you venture into other cryptos only if you seek outsized returns with little regard for risk.\n\nLitecoin (LTC-USD)\n\nSilver Litecoin coin facing forward on a pile of litecoins\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMuch like Bitcoin, Litecoin (LTC-USD) is a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain that undergoes a halving event. The next halving event for Litecoin will occur in August this year and cut mining rewards to 6.25 LTC from 12.5. That should significantly increase the value of this cryptocurrency, as it is among the most popular blockchains for miners after Ethereum shifted to a PoS consensus.\n\nFurthermore, while many thought of Litecoin as an old and irrelevant project, its recent MimbleWimble upgrade added much-needed utility and is bringing it back to relevancy. Litecoin users can now transact with the same degree of anonymity that many privacy coins such as Monero (XMR-USD) promise, but with Litecoin\u2019s block time of just 2.5 minutes.\n\nI believe LTC is at compelling levels and is bottoming out. It has gained 61%-plus from its trough last year, and I expect these gains to accelerate as it gets closer to halving. Next year, Bitcoin\u2019s halving will be the icing on the cake for this project.\n\nStorj (STORJ-USD)\n\nStorj Logo\n\nSource: storj.io\n\nI\u2019ve discussed Filecoin (FIL-USD) a considerable amount of times in my recent articles, and Storj (STORJ-USD) is similar to that project. The main difference between the two is that Storj maintains a central authority, while Filecoin is peer-to-peer. I believe both will be significant beneficiaries of the burgeoning cloud computing and storage industry, especially once decentralized storage becomes more mainstream.\n\nBlockchain storage is also cheaper than centralized counterparts that run data servers and has no censorship. On top of that, since the blockchain isn\u2019t a single server, the uptime and resiliency of these cloud storage platforms are remarkably high. These factors combined will make blockchain cloud storage projects highly-compelling to end users in the long-run.\n\nOf course, I only recommend small caps like Storj if your risk profile is aggressive. Sticking with more established projects such as Filecoin is a much better idea for long-term investing.\n\nTerareum (TERA-USD)\n\nAn image of a miner with a pickaxe mining digital coins, computer code and various numbers are overlaid on the image\n\nSource: Yev_1234 / Shutterstock\n\nTerareum (TERA-USD) is a centralized crypto exchange, and TERA is the native token of the project. Although the token has taken a hit from the selloff last year due to its small market capitalization and the effects of the current crypto winter affecting all altcoins in addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Terareum is highly likely to deliver disproportionately high returns due to its leading utility that has successfully launched on December last year. The Terareum exchange, also known as \u201cTERAREUM,\u201d offers lots of features under one roof, including debit cards, spot trading, and utilities such as Margin, Futures, and Staking capabilities. I recommend further researching the project on its website due to its complexity.\n\nIn addition, Terareum also has a cryptocurrency launchpad called Terapool. The launchpad raises liquidity for other crypto projects with much lower interest rates. Thus, the demand for this token will likely increase in the next cycle, due to new crypto projects and higher user influx into the Terareum exchange. The release in Quarter 3 of 2023 of an indigenous Layer 1 \u2013 Terareum Blockchain based on the PoS concept could also compel large institutional investors.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also Terapay which enables users to utilize fiat and crypto transactions as a mode of payment for goods using a single platform at many vendors and merchants for online costs. The payment gateway is adopted worldwide and could become a game-changer in the cryptocurrency & Web3 space.\n\nKalima.io (KLX-USD)\n\nBitcoin mining operation. Bitcoin mining farm. GREE stock.\n\nSource: Michal Bednarek / Shutterstock\n\nKalima (KLX-USD) piqued my interest because of the functionality the project aims to provide. On its website, it states that Kalima is a Layer 1 blockchain for enterprises and IoT (Internet of Things). This is a network of blockchains offering quick transactions and limitless scalability.\n\nKalima\u2019s full client nodes can be embedded not only on small IoT devices but also on supercomputers. This includes mobile and web clients, allowing for transactions to be managed with a latency of less than one second. Kalima smart contracts can also be executed on the client side, opening a new world of edge-computing and blockchain technology possibilities.\n\nIts token, KLX, secures the whole Kalima network, enabling the payment of transaction fees, staking, data governance, the acquisition of nodes for PrivaChains, and numerous essential other Kalima Network key functionalities. The Kalima Blockchain allows developers to have complete control of their dApps using standard languages and tools, their governance and business models. Project developers have implemented these features successfully, and I anticipate significant growth for its KLX token.\n\nFinally, Enedis (OTCMKTS:ECIFY), ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), Tenneco, and Spie are using Kalima\u2019s technology. That\u2019s quite a big plus when it comes to crypto, as only a few projects offer real-world utility. KLX will be listed on the 2nd of February on Bitmart.\n\nLoopring (LRC-USD)\n\nLoopring LRC token symbol of the DeFi system shining in the rays of light.\n\nSource: Vladimir Kazakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLoopring (LRC-USD) is among the most cyclical cryptos to buy. The primary purpose of this project is to supplement the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s scalability through zkRollups. Of course, this means that the project\u2019s objective becomes redundant when the Ethereum blockchain receives less traffic. Likewise, the opposite is true when the Ethereum network is congested during a crypto bull cycle.\n\nTherefore, buying LRC at the trough before Bitcoin\u2019s halving is an excellent idea. When the Ethereum blockchain becomes congested again, Loopring will offer disproportionately higher returns than the rest of the market.\n\nOn Low-Capitalization and Low-Volume Cryptocurrencies: InvestorPlace does not regularly publish commentary about cryptocurrencies that have a market capitalization of less than $100 million or trade with a volume less than $100,000 each day. That\u2019s because these \u201cpenny cryptos\u201d are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. When we do publish commentary on low-volume crypto that may be affected by our commentary, we ask that InvestorPlace.com\u2019s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: How to Avoid Popular Cryptocurrency Scams\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
