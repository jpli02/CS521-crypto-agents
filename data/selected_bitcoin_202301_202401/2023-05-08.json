Withdrawals had been down for over two hours on Monday in Asia."

        "title": "Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Block Rewards for the First Time Since 2017 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Amid Bitcoin\u2019s recent spike in transaction fees, block number 788695 marks a special milestone for miners: For the first time since 2017, the transaction fees in a single block surpassed the block rewards doled out to miners. Transaction fees in the block clocked in at 6.7 Bitcoin, beating the block subsidy of 6.25 Bitcoin.\n\nThough this spike in fees has thrown a curveball to users, this block shows how it's benefitting Bitcoin miners, the global network of volunteers that run expensive, specialized computers to secure the Bitcoin network. They\u2019re the ones raking in this newfound treasure trove of fees.\n\nBREAKING: #Bitcoin block 788695 contained transaction fees greater than the block subsidy. 6.7 BTC transaction fees + 6.25 BTC subsidy This is a the first time in history this has ever occurred due to competitively high block space demand. pic.twitter.com/J7IcwzIVKE \u2014 Joe Burnett (\ud83d\udd11)\u00b3 (@IIICapital) May 7, 2023\n\nBitcoin miners have two sources of income built in for them. One is the block subsidy. Roughly every 10 minutes, miners are awarded 6.25 Bitcoin. This value is split in half every four years in an event known as the Bitcoin \u201chalvening.\u201d\n\nThe second source is transaction fees. Users optionally can tag on a fee to every Bitcoin transaction. If there's more demand for Bitcoin, users need to hike their fee if they want it to get through in a timely manner. There's been lots of demand recently, pushing the average fee up to $19 according to cryptocurrency statistics website BitInfoCharts.\n\nAs such, the transaction fee source of income fluctuates somewhat erratically with demand.\n\n'Attack on Bitcoin\u2019 Claims Circulate as Transaction Fees Climb Higher\n\nOne reason bitcoiners find this surplus in fees so monumental is that eventually \u2014 in more than a hundred years \u2014 transaction fees will be miners' sole source of income. But transaction fees fluctuate so often, it hasn\u2019t yet been proven that it will provide a consistent source of income when that time finally rolls around.\n\nMiners are the glue holding Bitcoin together. The more hashing power provided by miners securing Bitcoin, the more secure Bitcoin is. But miners are unlikely to secure the network if they aren\u2019t paid to do it. Therefore it could be bad for Bitcoin if transaction fees don\u2019t increase over the years.\n\nBlock 788695 is a small, optimistic sign that fees could increase, even if it hasn't proved a consistent form of income for miners just yet. As self-custody platform Casa CTO Jameson Lopp put it on Twitter: \"The model for thermodynamic security has been proven possible. The only remaining question is if this demand is sustainable.\""

        "title": "Bitcoin slides after network congestion leads Binance to briefly halt withdrawals - CNBC",
        "content": "\"Only a break back below $25,000 would give reason for concern. Until then, we suspect dips will continue to be very well supported,\" he added.\n\n\"Reports of a large bitcoin outflow and withdrawals being paused at a major exchange could be factoring into some of the weakness we're seeing. Ultimately however, there haven't been any major developments as far as price action goes, with bitcoin still very much confined to a multiday bullish consolidation,\" said Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group.\n\nThe price of bitcoin was lower by 5.3% at $27,420.73, according to Coin Metrics. It has fallen 7% since Saturday. Ether fell 4.3% on Monday to $1,833.72.\n\nBitcoin fell to start the week, extending losses from a sharp drop over the weekend following reports by one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world about \"congestion\" on the Bitcoin network.\n\nMonday's drop came after Binance tweeted Sunday that the Bitcoin network was \"experiencing a congestion issue\" and that it was temporarily closing bitcoin withdrawals as a result until the network stabilized. Some market participants have argued that the Bitcoin network is stable and Binance should have prepared for a high-fee environment on Bitcoin.\n\nThe issue has highlighted a long-known setback of the Bitcoin network: It wasn't designed to handle a large number of transactions at scale. It processes just seven to 10 transactions per second, making it unviable as a potential rival to companies such as Visa and Mastercard \u2014 an idea many have explored over the years but largely put to rest. This is why projects such as the Lightning Network, which helps speed up transactions without affecting the network, have gained in popularity.\n\nService on Binance resumed, but later on Sunday evening the exchange again halted withdrawals.\n\n\"To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted,\" the Binance account tweeted. \"We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed. Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.\"\n\nA 'parabolic spike'\n\nAlex Thorn, head of firmwide research at Galaxy, noted a \"parabolic spike\" in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network last week, attributing it to users minting BRC-20 tokens. These are an experimental token on the Bitcoin blockchain that ultimately allow users to create NFTs on Bitcoin. They're inspired by Ethereum's ERC-20 token.\n\nOn May 1, about 50% of bitcoin transactions were BRC-20 mints, Thorn highlighted in a note Friday. In the 14 days preceding Friday, mean transaction fees on Bitcoin increased 297%.\n\n\"There is an increasing demand for BRC-20 tokens which include transferring digital collectibles on Bitcoin network,\" said Oppenheimer analyst Owen Lau. \"The Bitcoin network has gradually supported more different types of tokens like NFTs. This adoption should be a positive sign longer term but it looks like it has slowed down the network.\""

        "content": "Last month, Standard Chartered released a report that Bitcoin (BTC-USD) can hit $100,000 by the end of 2024. The target seems steep, but cryptocurrencies have a history of skyrocketing in the blink of an eye.\n\nStandard Chartered cites stress in the traditional banking system as one of the catalysts for a Bitcoin rally. I believe that a dovish stance by the Federal Reserve in the second half of 2023 will also contribute to the rally.\n\nAdditionally, Bitcoin halving is due in 2024. Going by past instances, the halving event is followed by a rally for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. With these positives, it\u2019s a good time to accumulate quality crypto projects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurther, investment can also be considered in some of the best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally. If Bitcoin touches $100,000, the crypto stocks to buy can deliver multibagger returns.\n\nLet\u2019s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these crypto stocks.\n\nCoinbase (COIN)\n\nCoinbase (COIN), is an American company that operates a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Ethereum (ETH-USD) coin on the background of the Coinbase inscription.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the second largest crypto exchange in the world, Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is among the best crypto stocks to buy.\n\nOn the day of the Q1 2023 results, COIN stock surged by 18%. This was on the back of a revenue and earnings beat. With Bitcoin likely to trend higher, I believe that COIN will remain in an uptrend.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the rally in Bitcoin and the broader crypto space translates into higher trading and speculative activity. The recovery in revenue along with margin improvement is on the cards in the coming quarters.\n\nCoinbase is also expanding its addressable market potential. In Q1, the company made inroads in Canada, Brazil, and Singapore. With plans to expand into more markets, revenue growth acceleration is likely to be meaningful.\n\nThe company\u2019s subscription and services revenue has also continued to swell. For Q1, the revenue was $361.7 million, which was higher by over 100% on a year-on-year basis. With a strong retail and institutional client base, the outlook is positive for COIN stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT)\n\nblockchain\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) has skyrocketed by 242% in year-to-date 2023. During this period, Bitcoin has surged by over 70%. The big rally is an indicator of the upside potential if Bitcoin touches $100,000.\n\nAs an overview, Riot Platforms is a Bitcoin miner. There are two reasons to like Riot over peers. First, the company has a solid balance sheet with zero debt and $230 million in cash and equivalents.\n\nFurther, Riot is a low-cost miner. Last year, the company reported a gross mining margin of 60.3%. With Bitcoin trending higher, I expect healthy EBITDA margin expansion and cash flow upside for the company.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Riot has been continuously increasing its mining capacity. As of April, the company reported a capacity of 10.6EH/s. Riot expects to boost capacity to 12.5EH/s in the second half of 2023. Considering the balance sheet health, I expect capacity expansion to continue. Therefore, there is visibility for robust revenue growth in 2023 and beyond.\n\nBlock (SQ)\n\nSquare, Inc. (SQ) logo seen displayed on smart phone. Square, Inc. is a financial services, merchant services aggregator, and mobile payment company\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) stock has been in a sustained downtrend. However, it remains in my list of best crypto stocks for a Bitcoin rally.\n\nIt was back in December 2021 that Square re-branded as Block. The idea was to emphasize the company\u2019s focus on blockchain technology. The bear market for cryptocurrencies has impacted developments. However, as the crypto winter ends, there are reasons to be bullish.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the company\u2019s Cash App is being used to buy and sell Bitcoin. Additionally, it was reported in 2021 that the company is building a decentralized finance business using Bitcoin. Last year, it was reported that Jack Dorsey was building Web5 based on Bitcoin.\n\nMy point is that there are developments in the background. Block has ample financial flexibility to invest in blockchain technology. With a big correction in SQ stock, it seems like a good time to accumulate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.
