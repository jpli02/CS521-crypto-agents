        "content": "A protracted dearth of liquidity in cryptocurrency markets is playing a key role in the more than 10% swings in the price of Bitcoin seen in recent weeks.\n\nMarket depth remains at its lowest point this year even with the recent resurgence in trading activity being spurred on in part by expectations for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, FalconX\u2019s research team found. They measure market depth by looking at the average volume of Bitcoin trading activities within 1% of its current price, on a 24-hour basis."

        "content": "In a compelling tale of persistence and financial prudence, a Reddit user embarked on a unique investment experiment, demonstrating the potential rewards of consistently investing small amounts, or dollar cost averaging, into Bitcoin.\n\nThe Redditor, going by the handle u/Gorillahair2000, initiated an experiment to determine whether allocating just $5 per day into Bitcoin was a worthwhile endeavor, over the course of one full year, diligently recorded their progress.\n\nAfter 365 days of investing $5 per day, the Redditor accumulated a total stack of 0.075 Bitcoin. The average purchase price stood at $24,108.58, while the current price of Bitcoin was $34,158.20.\n\nThe total expenditure over the year amounted to $1,825.00, and the current value of the investment was $2,585.75, yielding a net change of +41.68%.\n\nThe Redditor also noted that they accounted for the 0.5-1.0% spread on each of their purchases, meaning the gains remained after adjusting for fees. The user indicated that they buy with Strike, a popular Bitcoin Lightning wallet, and then withdraw the Bitcoin to a hardware wallet, in line with industry best practices.\n\nIn a year's time, they transformed the daily expense equivalent to a Starbucks coffee into $2,500 in current value, or a $750 gain.\n\nThe experiment conclusively proves that even with a modest budget, investing in Bitcoin can yield significant returns, and demonstrates the power of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy that involves consistently purchasing assets at fixed intervals, regardless of their price, thereby mitigating the effects of market volatility.\n\nFurther, it also highlights Bitcoin's main advantages as a sound money, one that doesn't depreciate like fiat currencies and other traditional savings vehicles.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin. Getty Images\n\nVanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC that the firm will not be pursuing a bitcoin ETF.\n\nRival asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity are waiting to get their applications approved.\n\nExcitement over a possible spot bitcoin ETF fueled the largest weekly inflow into digital assets since July 2022.\n\nNot all of Wall Street is planning on pursuing a spot bitcoin ETF, even as optimism rises on the regulatory pathway to create one.\n\nWhile asset management rivals such as BlackRock and Fidelity have applications pending, Vanguard CEO Tim Buckley told CNBC on Friday that his firm has no plans to follow suit.\n\n\"We won't be pursuing a bitcoin ETF. It's just like we don't use gold as an asset class for our clients,\" he said. \"It's not that people can't invest in there. We just look at asset classes or, you know, what belongs in a long-term portfolio, what has intrinsic value, has cash flows to it? And those are the asset classes we steer people towards. And so we don't go towards bitcoin or gold or any other of those stable assets.\"\n\nA spokesman later told Insider that Vanguard views the investment case for cryptocurrencies as weak.\n\n\"Unlike stocks and bonds, most cryptocurrencies lack intrinsic economic value and generate no cash flows, such as interest payments or dividends,\" he said. \"Further, cryptocurrencies have proven to be highly volatile, which runs counter to Vanguard's goal to generate positive real returns to investors over time.\"\n\nCurrently, BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application remains under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the regulator allows bitcoin futures ETFs, it has been largely critical of the cryptocurrency sphere, and has previously denied such applications.\n\nBut in August, Grayscale Investments won its court case against the SEC, which had earlier rejected an application to turn its over-the-counter traded bitcoin trust into an ETF.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe court decision raised hopes that the regulatory obstacles would be cleared, allowing for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF soon.\n\nMeanwhile, enthusiasm for a potential spot bitcoin ETF continues to grow on Wall Street. Earlier this month, crypto-bull Mike Novogratz told CNBC that it would make zero sense for an ETF to be blocked.\n\nMarkets are also demonstrating a readiness, and inflows into digital asset funds have jumped to their highest weekly level since July 2022.\n\nAccording to the latest Coin Shares report, digital asset investment inflows hit $326 million for the week, with bitcoin making up 90%.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "title": "4 Stocks to Watch as Bitcoin Briefly Breaches the $35,000 Mark - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has been rising steadily over the past two weeks, growing more than 25%. In the last week itself, it has gone up more than 14% and has briefly breached the $35,000 mark. Currently, it holds firm above the $34,000 support.\n\nThis broad-based BTC rally has coincided with mixed earnings numbers coming in from big tech in the stock market, and there is a visible shift being witnessed in investors who are fleeing the stock market to apply buy-side pressure on Bitcoin. It is widely speculated that the benchmark crypto might breach the $40,000 mark very soon.\n\nBeing the most well-known and \u201creliable\u201d digital coin, BTC has solidified its position within the market itself. In an uncertain environment, investors turn less speculative and rush to safety. The crypto market itself is hardly ever considered stable or safe, but even in this space, investors are prone to clinging to BTC in times of crypto rallies.\n\nWith growing institutional acceptance for crypto across geographies, the benchmark digital currency might be entering a period of less volatility and sustained growth. Multiple traditional financial houses applying for a Bitcoin ETF have also acted as a tailwind. However, this recent rally might be even more significant because it lends credence to the notion that investors are considering Bitcoin as a viable option in times when the stock market is getting routed over a period of time. It will be prudent to watch a few bitcoin-exposed stocks in this light.\n\nBlock Inc. SQ is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants. Users of Block\u2019s platforms can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin. In addition, SQ\u2019s platforms allow developers to build decentralized finance applications to run on programmable blockchains.SQ\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 69%.
