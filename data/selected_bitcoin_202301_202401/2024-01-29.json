        "content": "Chesnot | Getty Images\n\nThe price of bitcoin broke above the $43,000 level on Monday as the cryptocurrency extended its recent gains. Bitcoin was last trading higher by 2.93% at $43,097.35, according to Coin Metrics. Bitcoin has fought back into the green for the year following steep losses after the long-awaited approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin closed out 2023 around the $42,000 level. It is now up about 1.25% for 2024.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin rises above $43,000 Monday\n\nEther rose nearly 2.06% to $2,304.82. Solana's SOL token and Cardano's ADA led the crypto market gains. They rose 6.8% and 7.4%, respectively. Bitcoin ETFs have been the biggest driver of the cryptocurrency's price action in recent weeks. Outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF had disappointed some investors, who shook off those worries last week as they appeared to taper off."

        "content": "Experts Bet on $170K+ Bitcoin Price in Wake of 2024 Halving\n\nWith Bitcoin's next halving event just months away, optimism abounds that the cryptocurrency could reach dazzling new heights. Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci is among the crypto bulls forecasting eye-popping Bitcoin valuations in 2024 and beyond.\n\nScaramucci predicts Bitcoin will hit at least $170,000 in the 18 months following the halving in April when the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation gets cut in half. His projection is based on historical price performance, with Bitcoin tending to quadruple within that timeframe after previous halvings.\n\n\"The day that Bitcoin halves, multiply it by four and 18 months later and it\u2019s been uncanny that that\u2019s been the price of Bitcoin,\u201d said Scaramucci on a recent podcast.\n\nEven a \u201cconservative\u201d estimate of Bitcoin trading at $50,000 pre-halving would imply a $200,000 price tag post-halving, according to Scaramucci. Other optimistic forecasts come from Blockstream CEO Adam Back ($100,000+) and analysts at Standard Chartered Bank (also $100,000+).\n\nIn the long run, mega-bulls like Scaramucci see Bitcoin capturing half the market cap of gold, which would lift the cryptocurrency over $300,000 per coin. Scaramucci gave credit to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink for changing his once-negative stance on Bitcoin as digital gold."
