        "title": "Bitcoin Outlook 2024: What are the emerging themes to watch out for? - The Economic Times",
        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the investment universe gets ready to bid adieu, all signs point to the popularity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies getting bigger and better in 2024. As we step into 2024, the landscape of the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, and Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency, remains at the forefront. Bitcoin 's journey has been marked by both triumphs and challenges, and the year 2024 promises to bring about new trends and emerging themes that will shape the future of this decentralized digital asset. Before we get excited or curious about what 2024 is about to bring us, let us remember that studies and trends have showing an explosion of trends in cryptocurrency that investors can try to participate in. However, for the sake of this article, let us try to explore a handful of these themes that we can look forward to in the New Year.Despite the well-documented challenges faced by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in recent years, there has been a notable uptick of institutional interest in Bitcoin. All signs point to this intensifying in 2024, with more traditional financial institutions and corporations exploring ways to integrate Bitcoin into their portfolios. As regulatory clarity improves, it will only serve to strengthen Bitcoin's reputation as a store of value with institutions looking at using it increasingly as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.Another challenge that Bitcoin has been dealing with for a few decades is that of Scalability, leading to slow transaction processing times and higher fees during periods of high demand. In 2024, seeing the rise in fees, adoptability of layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network would see an increase. Lightning significantly enhances Bitcoin\u2019s transaction throughput. This would make microtransactions more feasible and contribute to a more efficient and scalable network.Consumption of energy by cryptocurrencies expended during mining of crypto has been a hot topic of debate and has been concerning environmentalists and environment-conscious folks for years. While there is no telling with absolute certainty if this problem is one that will be solved or not. However, in 2024, the industry is likely to witness increased efforts to address the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, data storage, etc. Innovations in sustainable mining practices, the use of renewable energy sources, and the development of eco-friendly consensus algorithms may emerge as key themes, aligning Bitcoin with broader environmental goals.The fast-growing technology that is soon if not already challenging the existing centralized monetary system, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has gained tremendous momentum in the cryptocurrency space. Come 2024, and it is expected that Bitcoin will expect to be more widely accepted to play a more active role in this ecosystem. Projects exploring the integration of Bitcoin with DeFi applications could open up new avenues for lending, borrowing, and trading, allowing users to leverage Bitcoin in a decentralized financial landscape. 2024 will also more than likely see the connection of more TradFi and DeFi bridges and gateways which will bring about a constant flurry of the development of innovative hybrid financial products. An increase in the number of connections will facilitate the seamless flow of capital between traditional / centralised finance and DeFi thereby legitimising the world of crypto in India.It is widely expected across the cryptocurrency world that India will announce and implement a proper set of regulatory guidelines for the protection and understanding of its 20 million investors in 2024. It is no secret that clearer regulatory frameworks may provide a sense of security for investors and businesses, fostering a more robust and stable ecosystem. The institution of these much-needed guidelines will go a long way in bringing about a great deal of clarity and regulation from various jurisdictions, which could positively impact the adoption and use of Bitcoin on a global scale.Privacy remains a fundamental concern in the cryptocurrency space, and in all likelihood 2024, will see an increased emphasis on privacy enhancements, such as the integration of technologies like CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions. These features could offer users greater privacy and fungibility, making Bitcoin transactions more confidential and resistant to surveillance.Often dubbed \"digital gold\" and a hedge against economic uncertainties, with as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties likely to persist at least through H1 2024. Bitcoin may continue to attract investors seeking a store of value and a diversification strategy. While Bitcoin is primarily known for its role as a digital currency, developments in 2024 may pave the way for the integration of smart contracts on the Bitcoin network. This would bring additional functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain, allowing for more complex programmable transactions and potentially expanding its use cases.Over the course of the last few years, the process of altering real-world assets into digital tokens, is gaining some serious momentum. 2024 is expected to see tokenizing of traditional assets, such as financial assets, commodities, real estate, or even intellectual property, fractional ownership can be created, liquidity could be enhanced liquidity, while allowing for democratize access to these modern asset classes. 2023 saw a rise in Ordinals making use of the Taproot upgrade. Ordinals are basically NFTs on bitcoin. Ordinals emphasizes Premium art and we predict this market would see a substantial rise with many startups emerging in 2024. This is one of the factors of driving fees up. In the New Year, investors can expect further advancements in tokenization protocols and the emergence of tokenized assets enabling individuals the opportunity to invest in a wider range of assets using lesser amounts of capital. With greater tokenisation comes a more viable opportunity for institutional investors to diversify their investment portfolio.The Bitcoin industry is more than likely to see a significant increase in the number of ETFs especially after the filing of a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock which will go a long way in opening up the participation Institutional investors in the Bitcoin world. A financial player as large and reputed as BlackRock entering the world of Bitcoin in 2023 bodes well for 2024 when it comes to the adoption of digital crypto assets. This action of BlackRock has shown that the future of Bitcoin is extremely bright with their more than likely integration into the financial world. 2024 could just prove to be the year of Crypto ETFs as other institutions are watching and waiting for regulatory approvals before they decide to follow suit and change the world of Bitcoin forever.Despite never-ending criticism from the naysayers, 2024 promises to be a pivotal year marked by the promise of a great deal of financial innovation in the world of cryptocurrency. Moving further into the digital age will see greater in the whole ecosystem of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies resulting in Bitcoin being poised to play an increasingly significant role in the global financial landscape. Keeping an eye on these emerging themes will be crucial for investors, enthusiasts, and industry participants as they navigate the dynamic and exciting world of cryptocurrency in 2024.(Roshan Aslam is Co-founder & CEO at GoSats)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "These are the boldest bitcoin predictions for 2024 \u2014 one calls for a 1,000% rally to $500,000 - CNBC",
        "content": "In this article BTC.CM= Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT\n\nFilip Radwanski | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nBitcoin had a huge rally in 2023, with the digital currency up some 152% for the year. And a number of commentators CNBC spoke to \u2014 both inside and outside of the cryptocurrency industry \u2014 expect the rise to continue. After hitting a record high in 2021, bitcoin had a rough 2022, which was marked by the collapse of high-profile projects, liquidity issues and bankruptcies. That year, FTX, once one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, filed for bankruptcy. In 2023, its founder Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty of all seven criminal counts brought against him by federal prosecutors in the U.S. Also in 2023, Binance's Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to criminal charges and stepped down as the company's CEO as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice.\n\nNow that those two high-profile cases are out the way, many cryptocurrency executives see it as a chance to move forward and draw a line under the bad behavior of two of the industry's poster children. With fervor returning to the crypto markets, industry executives are calling the start of a new bull run, mainly predicated on two things \u2014 the bitcoin \"halving\" and the potential approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The halving, which happens every four years, is an event written in bitcoin's code. The rewards so-called miners get for mining bitcoin is cut in half. This keeps a cap on supply of bitcoin, of which there will only ever be 21 million. In previous price cycles, halving preceded a rise in the price of bitcoin. Meanwhile, there is growing excitement that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve the first ever bitcoin ETF, after years of opposition. This would mean investors can buy a product that tracks the price of bitcoin, without having to go on to an exchange and hold the digital currency directly. The industry is hoping this will draw in a wider range of investors, and in particular, large institutional investors. With all of this excitement comes some quite bold predictions about bitcoin's price. Here's a selection of some of them.\n\nMark Mobius: $60,000\n\nIn 2022, Mark Mobius correctly forecast bitcoin would drop to $20,000 when it was trading above $28,000. He had a price call of $10,000 thereafter, which he stuck to in 2023. However, that did not materialize, as bitcoin rallied. For 2024, Mobius told CNBC that bitcoin could reach $60,000 by the end of the year. \"No rationale for that prediction,\" Mobius said, except that a bitcoin ETF looks likely and \"that has heightened interest\" in the cryptocurrency.\n\nBit Mining: $75,000\n\nYouwei Yang, chief economist of crypto mining firm Bit Mining, believes that bitcoin could reach a high of $75,000 by 2024. Yang attributes the anticipated price rise to a bitcoin ETF being approved, leading to higher institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as May 2024's bitcoin halving, which would result in the bitcoin supply being constrained. \"I anticipate the Bitcoin will be trading around $25K to $75K in 2024, and $45K to $130K in 2025,\" Yang said in an emailed note. \"While high prices are possible, not all investors will profit due to market volatility and the human tendencies of fear and greed.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's price performance over the last year.\n\nYang said the ETF approval remains the biggest story for bitcoin in 2024 \u2014 though investors should hold a degree of caution on timing given the wounds left by collapses of major crypto firms like Luna and FTX, and as it is an election year when the topic of crypto is likely to become more of a political issue. \"Timing the market is hard, but a gradual approach \u2014 accumulating in bear markets and taking profits in bull markets \u2014 might be a more effective strategy for whom don't have early-on accumulations.\"\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said the landscape for digital assets is set for \"significant change\" in 2024, driven by the potential approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \"This long-awaited development is poised to expand the investor base for cryptocurrencies and integrate them more closely with traditional financial markets,\" Butterfill told CNBC via email. \"Estimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000.\" Meanwhile, the scenario of central banks cutting interest rates could also \"play a decisive role\" in moving bitcoin higher, Butterfill added. The market will be also looking at factors beyond the halving \u2014 which he considers already priced into bitcoin \u2014 that could influence the price of the digital coin further. \"Thus, while the halving is a known event, other elements, particularly the potential for interest rate reductions, are likely to be significant in shaping Bitcoin's price in the future,\" Butterfill said.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, a noted bitcoin bull and co-founder of Nexo, a cryptocurrency exchange, believes bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2024. In 2022, he called for bitcoin to hit $100,000, but that didn't happen. Instead, the price of bitcoin collapsed that year. He held off from any further price predictions. But in a note in December, Trenchev reinstated his $100,000 call for 2024, citing the halving and potential approval of multiple bitcoin ETFs. \"My expectation for 2024 is that the twin-turbo boost from the Bitcoin halving & spot ETF approval should propel Bitcoin to $100,000, with the prospect of further highs in 2025,\" Trenchev said in a note. \"The road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin.\" Trenchev added that the biggest gains will come from digital tokens and projects \"that aren't even on the radar yet.\"\n\nStandard Chartered: $100,000\n\nIn November, Standard Chartered doubled down on its $100,000 call for bitcoin made in April. The bank said this will be driven by the approval of numerous ETFs. The halving will also be supportive for bitcoin, the bank said.\n\nCarol Alexander: $100,000\n\nIn 2022, University of Sussex professor of finance Carol Alexander had a fairly successful run of calling bitcoin's future price. She predicted bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. That year, bitcoin fell as low as around $15,480, according to CoinDesk data. For 2023, Alexander said bitcoin would rally as high as $50,000. Bitcoin reached a yearly high of roughly $44,700 in early December. Alexander told CNBC that during the first quarter of 2024, bitcoin will trade within the $40,000 to $55,000 range, owing to \"professional traders creating volatility.\" The next stage will depend on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settles charges against Coinbase and Binance, which could be required before approval of a bitcoin ETF, according to Alexander, echoing other commentators. The SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance in 2023.\n\nAlexander said settlement of those charges is likely in either the second or third quarter, after which ETFs will be approved and bitcoin's price will rise to $70,000, a new all-time high. The price after that depends on the abilities of the ETF providers, such as Blackrock and Fidelity, \"to equip their market makers not only to create the ETFs, but also to defend price manipulations\" on exchanges which create \"excessive volatility.\" \"Before end of 2024 price could exceed $100k, but only if Blackrock and Fidelity market maker algorithms have the ability to reduce volatility,\" Alexander concluded.\n\nMatrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note in November projecting that bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\" Many commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin, which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife, though many disagree with this theory.\n\nCoinFund: Up to $500,000"

Yang attributes the anticipated price rise to a bitcoin ETF being approved, leading to higher institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as May 2024's bitcoin halving, which would result in the bitcoin supply being constrained. \"I anticipate the Bitcoin will be trading around $25K to $75K in 2024, and $45K to $130K in 2025,\" Yang said in an emailed note. \"While high prices are possible, not all investors will profit due to market volatility and the human tendencies of fear and greed.\"\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Bitcoin's price performance over the last year.\n\nYang said the ETF approval remains the biggest story for bitcoin in 2024 \u2014 though investors should hold a degree of caution on timing given the wounds left by collapses of major crypto firms like Luna and FTX, and as it is an election year when the topic of crypto is likely to become more of a political issue. \"Timing the market is hard, but a gradual approach \u2014 accumulating in bear markets and taking profits in bull markets \u2014 might be a more effective strategy for whom don't have early-on accumulations.\"\n\nJames Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said the landscape for digital assets is set for \"significant change\" in 2024, driven by the potential approval of bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. \"This long-awaited development is poised to expand the investor base for cryptocurrencies and integrate them more closely with traditional financial markets,\" Butterfill told CNBC via email. \"Estimations suggest that a 20% investment increase from current assets under management (around US$3 billion) could potentially propel Bitcoin prices to US$80,000.\" Meanwhile, the scenario of central banks cutting interest rates could also \"play a decisive role\" in moving bitcoin higher, Butterfill added. The market will be also looking at factors beyond the halving \u2014 which he considers already priced into bitcoin \u2014 that could influence the price of the digital coin further. \"Thus, while the halving is a known event, other elements, particularly the potential for interest rate reductions, are likely to be significant in shaping Bitcoin's price in the future,\" Butterfill said.\n\nAntoni Trenchev, a noted bitcoin bull and co-founder of Nexo, a cryptocurrency exchange, believes bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2024. In 2022, he called for bitcoin to hit $100,000, but that didn't happen. Instead, the price of bitcoin collapsed that year. He held off from any further price predictions. But in a note in December, Trenchev reinstated his $100,000 call for 2024, citing the halving and potential approval of multiple bitcoin ETFs. \"My expectation for 2024 is that the twin-turbo boost from the Bitcoin halving & spot ETF approval should propel Bitcoin to $100,000, with the prospect of further highs in 2025,\" Trenchev said in a note. \"The road to $100,000 will be lined with unexpected potholes and double-digit declines as Bitcoin.\" Trenchev added that the biggest gains will come from digital tokens and projects \"that aren't even on the radar yet.\"\n\nStandard Chartered: $100,000\n\nIn November, Standard Chartered doubled down on its $100,000 call for bitcoin made in April. The bank said this will be driven by the approval of numerous ETFs. The halving will also be supportive for bitcoin, the bank said.\n\nCarol Alexander: $100,000\n\nIn 2022, University of Sussex professor of finance Carol Alexander had a fairly successful run of calling bitcoin's future price. She predicted bitcoin would slip to $10,000 in 2022. That year, bitcoin fell as low as around $15,480, according to CoinDesk data. For 2023, Alexander said bitcoin would rally as high as $50,000. Bitcoin reached a yearly high of roughly $44,700 in early December. Alexander told CNBC that during the first quarter of 2024, bitcoin will trade within the $40,000 to $55,000 range, owing to \"professional traders creating volatility.\" The next stage will depend on when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settles charges against Coinbase and Binance, which could be required before approval of a bitcoin ETF, according to Alexander, echoing other commentators. The SEC sued both Coinbase and Binance in 2023.\n\nAlexander said settlement of those charges is likely in either the second or third quarter, after which ETFs will be approved and bitcoin's price will rise to $70,000, a new all-time high. The price after that depends on the abilities of the ETF providers, such as Blackrock and Fidelity, \"to equip their market makers not only to create the ETFs, but also to defend price manipulations\" on exchanges which create \"excessive volatility.\" \"Before end of 2024 price could exceed $100k, but only if Blackrock and Fidelity market maker algorithms have the ability to reduce volatility,\" Alexander concluded.\n\nMatrixport, which bills itself as a crypto financial services firm, released a note in November projecting that bitcoin would reach $63,140 by April 2024 and $125,000 by the end of next year. \"Based on our inflation model, the macro environment is expected to remain a robust tailwind for crypto. Another decline in inflation is anticipated, prompting the Federal Reserve to likely initiate interest rate cuts,\" Matrixport said in its report. \"Combined with geopolitical crosscurrents, this healthy dose of monetary support should push Bitcoin to new highs in 2024.\" Many commentators see easing monetary policy as supportive for bitcoin, which is viewed as a risky asset. Meanwhile, some see bitcoin as a sort of \"safe haven\" asset to pour money into in times of geopolitical strife, though many disagree with this theory.\n\nCoinFund: Up to $500,000"
