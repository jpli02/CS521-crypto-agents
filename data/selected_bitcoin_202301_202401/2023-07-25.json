        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat on Wednesday morning in Asia as risk-aversion remained the market theme, though the token managed to hold above US$29,000. Analysts say a possible extended legal fight between the U.S. regulator and Ripple Labs as well as comments from the Federal Reserve on the interest rate outlook expected later today is breeding caution. Ether also treaded water, while other leading tokens were a mixed picture. Dogecoin led the winners again on speculation it may be integrated into Twitter as the social media app gets revamped into a more general-purpose platform. Elsewhere, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped and U.S. equity futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday.\n\nBitcoin lacking catalysts\n\nBitcoin inched 0.14% higher over the last 24 hours to US$29,222 as of 07:35 a.m. in Hong Kong, but lost 2.07% for the week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. After briefly falling to a monthly low of US$28,890 on Monday, the world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency has seemingly found support around US$29,000.\n\n\u201cSeveral factors are currently affecting Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, including concerns about the Ripple case resumption and investors\u2019 speculation on Bitcoin investment funds,\u201d Rania Gule, an analyst at Cyprus-headquartered multi-asset broker XS Group, said in an emailed comment.\n\nThe market is keeping a close eye on the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate decision, while negative headlines about Binance, the world\u2019s largest digital currency exchange, contributed to price declines across crypto, Gule added.\n\n\u201cThe main trendline support currently stands at $26,800, and as long as Bitcoin remains above it, the trend is expected to be bullish,\u201d said Gule.\n\nWilliam Cai, co-founder and managing partner at New York-based asset manager Wilshire Phoenix, said Bitcoin has been trading within a tight US$25,000 to US$30,000 range and is in search of a story and \u201ca major Fed rate or language surprise this week could provide the impetus needed to break out.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nReflecting the current lacklustre trend, CoinMarketCap\u2019s fear and greed index, a measure of market buy and sell sentiment, fell further into neutral territory on Wednesday with a reading of 52.\n\nThe caution was reflected in digital asset investment products that saw net outflows of US$6.5 million in the week ending July 21, following four prior weeks of consecutive inflows that totaled US$742 million, according to a Monday report from European cryptocurrency investment firm CoinShares.\n\nTrading volumes in such investment products last week fell to US$1.2 billion, below the yearly average and down from US$2.4 billion the prior week, according to CoinShares. By regions, the U.S. and Canada saw 97% of the total outflows of US$21.7 million.\n\nBitcoin-backed investment products were the primary focus which saw US$13 million of outflows last week, while Ether-backed products logged an inflow of US$6.6 million, suggesting sentiment is improving around the second largest cryptocurrency.\n\nEther edged up 0.41% to US$1,857 in early trading in Asia on Wednesday, but remained 2.17% lower for the week.\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Dogecoin, XRP, and Tron\u2019s TRX logging gains, while the rest declined. Polygon\u2019s Matic led the losers, falling 2.84% to US$0.7081 and down 4.12% for the week.\n\nDogecoin again headed the winners list on optimism it could become a feature in Twitter\u2019s rebranding to X.com, which will include functions such as \u201cpayments/banking,\u201d according to Twitter Chief Executive Officer Linda Yaccarino on Monday.\n\n\u201cDogecoin rallied recently as speculation increased that the meme coin could be used as a payment mechanism for the rebranded Twitter platform,\u201d said Markus Thielen, head of crypto research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cAs crypto is entering the summer lull that we initially expected for August, DOGE might be the summer\u2019s highflyer as other crypto themes are taking a backseat.\u201d\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.22% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume fell 27.41% to US$25.68 billion.\n\nForkast 500 dips, Axie Infinity developer to make NFT game with CyberKongz\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe main Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.60% in the past 24 hours to 2,642.91 as of 09:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, down 2.60% for the week. Forkast\u2019s Ethereum, Solana and Polygon NFT market indexes also logged losses, while the Cardano index edged higher.\n\nTotal NFT trading volume dipped 2.90% in the past 24 hours to US$17.77 million, according to data from CryptoSlam. Volumes on the Polygon Solana and Bitcoin networks rose, while Ethereum, BNB Chain and Cardano logged losses\n\nBy NFT collections, Ethereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) topped the 24-hour trading volumes, though total trades fell 39.79% to around US$695,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another slow day in the NFT market, with a majority of NFT trades still being wash trades, or sellers accepting points farmers offer on Blur,\u201d said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs.\n\nThe floor prices of leading Ethereum NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) have dropped 18% and 25% in the past 30 days, while trading volumes in the two collections over the same period slumped 80% and 67% respectively, according to NFT data tracker WGMI.io.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing happening out there to make buyers want to buy NFTs at the prices they\u2019re at still. Really, they\u2019re massively overpriced even after declining over the year,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nYuga Labs, the developer of BAYC and MAYC, launched \u201cMade by Apes\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 a platform that grants BAYC and MAYC holders unique on-chain licences for their own products or services featuring the ape-themed NFTs.\n\nBAYC holders have already been building businesses around their collections, including fast food, clothing, and beverage operations, and more brands are using BAYC in promotions.\n\n\u201cDuring this bear market we are seeing actual utility begin to get fleshed out like with Yuga Labs\u2019 new fully on-chain IP licensing platform,\u201d said Petscher.\n\nElsewhere, Sky Mavis, the Vietnam-based developer behind play-to-earn NFT game Axie Infinity, announced a partnership with NFT project CyberKongz on Tuesday, where the two will jointly develop an NFT game based on CyberKongz\u2019s incoming Genkai NFT collection.\n\nU.S. equity futures stall ahead of Fed move\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell|Image: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures traded mixed as of 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday in Hong Kong, with Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures inching lower, while S&P 500 futures edged up.\n\nAll three major U.S. indexes closed higher in regular Tuesday trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average logging gains for the 12th consecutive day, extending its longest winning streak in six years.\n\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes fell on Wednesday ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate announcement later today. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei all logged losses.\n\nAlthough a China Politburo meeting on Monday pledged policies to support the country\u2019s ailing property market and revive domestic consumption, China\u2019s stock market requires imminent and actionable measures from the government, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday citing a note by U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe U.S. Fed announces its interest rate decision on Wednesday with analysts at the CME FedWatch Tool predicting a 98.9% chance for a 25-basis-point rate hike this month.\n\nWith a rise in rates mostly priced into markets, the focus of attention will be comments by Fed chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank views inflation trends, offering some pointers on future monetary policies.\n\nThe current Fed under Powell has raised rates 10 times since March 2022 to tackle inflation that was running at 40-year highs last year. The annual inflation rate has since fallen to 3% in June from more than 9% last year.\n\nHowever, with inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%, economists forecast more potential hikes this year based on recent comments by Powell.\n\nOn the economic data front, the U.S. consumer confidence index hit a two-year high in July, according to the U.S. think tank Conference Board on Tuesday, \u201clikely reflecting lower inflation and a tight labor market.\u201d\n\nThe consumer confidence index, together with data on inflation, the housing market and retail sales, contributed to the optimism that the U.S. economy could avoid a recession in 2023, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section, adds fear and greed index in first section.)"

        "content": "In this article, we will share Nouriel Roubini's Bitcoin views and other predictions. If you want to see more of his predictions, check out 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nHe sounded like a madman when he stood at a packed International Monetary Fund conference in 2006 and predicted a global economic recession. But he was a prophet when he returned to the same conference in 2007. Welcome to the world of Nouriel Roubini, a renowned economist born in Istanbul to a Jewish family that has been the center of many economic events that have shaped the world over the past 20 years.\n\nRoubini studied economics in Italy against his parents' expectations, as they expected him to continue the family legacy in the rug dealing business. As the black sheep of the family, he would go against the grain, going on to obtain a Ph.D. in international economics at Harvard University. A stint at Yale University as an economist lecturer would pave the way for him to take up a teaching position at New York University, bringing him to the global capital of all financial matters.\n\nIn a field with dozens of people giving analysis and predictions, Roubini has always stood out owing to his unusual approach to analyzing and predicting the economy. His model is not like any other, as it relies on intuition to predict what is likely to happen. Amid the successes in predicting how the global economy is expected to fare, he has also attracted criticism owing to his relentless prediction of disasters.\n\nHe is often referred to as Wall Street's Doom economist owing to his track record in predicting some of the biggest catastrophes that have engulfed the global economy. He first shone to light in 2006 as he accurately predicted the collapse of the U.S. market that would eventually trigger one of the biggest and most consequential financial crises.\n\nIn 2019, at the height of Donald Trump's presidency, he predicted that an escalating US-China trade war would escalate into a cold war and a currency war. Nothing could be further from the truth as the two countries are entangled in a vicious supremacy war around emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, critical minerals, and semiconductors. Likewise, China is spearheading the creation of a new currency to counter the dollar's edge as a global reserve currency.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoubini is also on record predicting that the COVID-19 pandemic would trigger greater depression than the 1930s depression. The pandemic ended up triggering significant supply chain pressures leading to a four-decade high inflation rate in several countries. While the U.S. economy has recovered, the prospect of another recession on the horizon is high.\n\nNouriel Roubini on Bitcoin and Other Predictions\n\nSource: pixabay\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on an interest rate cut frenzy to stimulate the economy. Cutting interest rates to near zero triggered heightened inflation as growth stagnated. As inflation levels rose to 30-year highs, Roubini warned that the FED would struggle to do what it needs to try to lower inflation levels without triggering a recession. That was the case as inflation rose to about 9.2% representing 40-year highs.\n\nWhile the FED did embark on an aggressive monetary policy tightening to try and bring inflation below the recommended 2% levels, Roubini has warned that the economy could be heeded to a deep recession. After an aggressive interest rate hike to above the 5% level, the supply of money was reduced significantly, with businesses needing help to access cheap capital needed to accelerate economic activity. Roubini believes the economy is headed toward a deep recession with those thinking of a mild recession are delusional.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nRoubini's accurate foresight of major economic events has cemented his position as one of the world's most prominent and reliable economists. In this article, we will explore Roubini's predictions over the years and what he believes the future will be all about amid the cryptocurrency revolution. This list reviewed Roubini\u2019s major predictions and their impact on the global economy. We ranked them chronologically from when the predictions were made. Let's delve into some of his most notable predictions and their impact on the global financial landscape.\n\n10. The Financial Crisis: 2007-2009\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis is arguably one of the biggest economic events that propelled Roubini to prominence. Two years before the global economy plunged into recession, the economist had warned of a potential housing bubble, excessive leverage, and risky financial practices. While at first, he seemed like a prophet of doom, his predictions materialized, affirming his status as one of the ears worth listening to on economic matters.\n\nAs early as 2005, the economist had warned that the housing market was in a bubble due to the low-interest rate environment and lax lending standards fueled by speculative demand. It's his prediction that the housing burst would spill into the financial sector that affirmed his predictions as 2009 saw the implosion of many financial institutions, including the Lehman brothers\n\nHis prediction that the financial crisis would severely impact the real economy came true as consumers and businesses were forced to cut spending as the U.S. economy plunged into recession in 2009.\n\n9. European Debt Crisis: 2010-2013\n\nRoubini was one of the first economists to call out the European debt crisis spearheaded by Greece, which eventually had a ripple effect on the entire economic block. As early as 2010, the economist warned that the Eurozone was storing many problems by failing to tackle the debt crisis head-on. He also warned that Greece was insolvent and not in any position to repay its debt without massive restructuring or bailout.\n\nThe New York-based economists had also warned that the debt crisis would spill to other European nations, mostly affecting Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Spain; he termed the countries as some that faced massive problems with debt, low growth, and weak competitiveness.\n\nThe warnings came true as Greece defaulted on its debt obligations prompting a massive bailout. Greece, Portugal, and Ireland were also bailed out as they faced unsustainable debt levels. The E.U. was forced to thrash out a series of packages to ensure that Greece was funded through 2014.\n\n8. Chinese Economy Bubble Burst: 2011-2013\n\nRoubini once again shot into the limelight in 2011 as he warned that the Chinese economy faced a probability of a hard landing. The warning came amid concerns that the economy was highly dependent on U.S. consumers. At the time, the global economy was running on two engines, the U.S., on one part, as the consumer, and China, on the other hand, as the chief producer.\n\nWith the U.S. facing a collapse of consumption and consumer confidence amid plunging housing, auto sales, and durable goods spending, Roubini warned that China's economy was in big trouble. China being structurally dependent on exports at the time was a big problem, according to Roubini, who feared its hard landing amid waning consumption in the U.S. would end up impacting the global markets.\n\nThe economists had warned that the economy would face a hard landing in 2013. However, that did not materialize. While the Chinese economy has faced a number of issues over the years, it has managed to maintain high growth rates and stay afloat.\n\n7. Emerging Market Currency Crisis: 2013-2014\n\nAs the U.S. economy returned from the 2009 financial crisis, the federal reserve embarked on tightening monetary policy that included hiking interest rates. In 2013, Roubini warned that increased quantitative tightening and tapering by the FED would trigger significant issues for emerging market economies.\n\nThe prediction did come true as the tapering caused emerging markets to face capital outflows and currency depreciation as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the major currencies starting in 2014. The strengthening of the dollar put downward pressure on the exchange rates of emerging markets, especially those with large current account deficits and low foreign exchange reserves.\n\nAmid massive capital outflows, emerging market economies ended up struggling with lower growth and higher inflation. The countries faced higher import costs amid reduced purchasing power on weakened currencies and a stronger dollar.\n\n6. Oil Price Collapse 2014-2015\n\nAmid increased U.S. shale oil production and OPEC members failing to initiate any production cuts, Roubini warned of an imminent collapse in oil prices in 2014. Due to technological advancements, innovation, and efficiency gains, the U.S. shale oil companies ramped up production, consequently putting pressure on prices.\n\nOPEC, on the other hand, failed to stabilize the oil market through production cuts. Roubini warned of the long-term impact of Saudi Arabia's failure to cut its production quota in 2014 despite the falling process.\n\nThe result was the oil market experiencing its biggest price decline in modern history as oil prices fell more than 50% due to a glut in supply. Oil prices fell from above $70 a barrel to lows of $30 a barrel level. According to Roubini, the price decline was fueled by a slowdown in demand from major oil-importing countries, including China and India.\n\nRoubini's prediction did come true as the collapse of oil prices had a negative impact on the global economy as growth fell amid higher inflation and financial instability. The collapse also triggered a debt crisis in major oil-exporting countries, including Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Nouriel Roubini Predictions.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: None.
