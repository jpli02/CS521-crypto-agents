        "content": "Recasts, adds details on spot bitcoin ETF paragraphs 4-6, context and analyst comment 7-8\n\nSINGAPORE, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on Tuesday for the first time since April 2022 as the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency started 2024 with a bang buoyed by optimism around possible approval of exchange-traded spot bitcoin funds.\n\nBitcoin BTC=BTSP touched a 21-month peak of $45,488, having gained 154% last year in the strongest performance since 2020. It was last up 2.6% at $45,344 but remains far off the record high of $69,000 it touched in November 2021.\n\nEther ETH=BTSP, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, was 1% higher at $2,376 on Tuesday.\n\nInvestor focus has been squarely on whether the U.S. securities regulator will soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF, which would throw open the bitcoin market to millions more investors.\n\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected multiple applications to launch spot bitcoin ETFs in recent years, arguing that the cryptocurrency market is vulnerable to manipulation.\n\nIn recent months, however, there have been increasing signs that regulators are prepared to sign off on at least some of the 13 proposed spot bitcoin ETFs, with expectations that the decision will likely come in early January.\n\nRising bets that major central banks will cut interest rates this year has also been a boon for cryptocurrencies, helping shake off the gloom that had settled over crypto markets following the collapse of FTX and other crypto-business failures in 2022.\n\n\"The crypto market is set to experience notable growth this year, with key influencing factors being the influx of investment funds from spot ETFs, Bitcoin halving, and a more accommodative monetary policy both in the United States and worldwide,\" said Jupiter Zheng, partner of liquid funds at HashKey Capital.\n\n(Reporting by Ankur Banerjee in Singapore and Summer Zhen in Hong Kong; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)\n\n((ankur.banerjee@thomsonreuters.com;; Mobile - +65 8121 3925; Follow on X (formerly Twitter): @AnkurBanerjee17;))\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "One of us is from Kentucky and the other from China. We both attend Washington and Lee University in Virginia. Last summer, we assisted Professor Seth Cantey, also a co-author of this piece, with research on the roles of bitcoin and Tether in Lebanon. To help with that work, first we had to learn a lot. What is bitcoin, and what are the problems it\u2019s trying to solve? How is it being used in Lebanon? Could bitcoin adoption mitigate the economic crisis? For two months, we wrestled with these questions.\n\nBut another question came up too. What does our generation, Gen Z, think of bitcoin?\n\nGen Z, the demographic cohort succeeding Millennials, includes those born from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. Basically, we\u2019re digital natives in our teens and twenties. We\u2019re already entering adulthood, taking up an increasing share of the workforce, and contributing to the global economy. We\u2019re not Blackrock, but whether and how we adopt bitcoin will matter for the currency and the network in the long term. So, we decided to ask our peers what they thought about the technology. And we have some thoughts of our own.\n\nOur survey was simple, not scientific, but we found it anecdotally useful. We asked two open-ended questions to dozens of peers in the United States and China: 1) What is your understanding of bitcoin? 2) How often do you come across it? We were especially interested in whether answers to these questions varied by geography, since the US and China have radically different policies vis-\u00e0-vis bitcoin and cryptocurrency generally.\n\nResponses from our peers were similar in some ways, different in others. Gen Zers in both countries view bitcoin mainly as an investment option. In the US, they tend to see it as a speculative investment, but one that\u2019s attracting increasing attention and gradually becoming a more prominent part of investor strategies. They also think savvy investors wouldn\u2019t allocate a large percentage of their portfolios to bitcoin. It\u2019s understood as \u201chigh-risk, high-reward.\u201d Chinese Gen Zers similarly regard bitcoin as a speculative investment, but they tend to be even more cautious. In China, bitcoin brings to mind gambling, cheating, and crime, all activities with potentially serious consequences. The Chinese government has made clear to its citizens that bitcoin is not backed by the state, creating the perception of a lack of guaranteed value.\n\nWhen asked whether and how they\u2019ve noticed bitcoin in everyday life, American Gen Zers characterize bitcoin\u2019s presence as peripheral. They\u2019ve seen bitcoin ATMs at gas stations, Coinstar machines while buying groceries, and payment options at certain online stores. Even QR codes at a few restaurants. In other words, they know bitcoin is out there, but it still feels like a novelty. In contrast, Chinese rarely see bitcoin in their daily lives. China\u2019s decision to ban bitcoin mining in 2021 contributed to the population\u2019s sense that it\u2019s mostly off limits. And while there has never been an explicit ban on holding bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in China, trading is illegal, and Beijing has warned banks and other financial institutions against providing crypto services.\n\nWhile our peers don\u2019t qualify as a representative sample of Gen Z, their views make sense to us, because they resemble what our own thinking was before working on this topic over the summer.\n\nBut that thinking has changed. After months of learning about bitcoin, we now recognize it as much more than an investment option. In Lebanon, where the banking and financial systems have collapsed, bitcoin serves as a savings tool and a hedge against inflation. In Russia, it\u2019s become a lifeline for dissidents whose bank accounts have been frozen. In Nigeria, it\u2019s a remittance vehicle with the potential to put companies like Western Union out of business. Refugees fleeing Ukraine have used it to transport wealth on hardware wallets or in their heads. El Salvador has made it the centerpiece of a campaign to attract high tech entrepreneurs and tourism. The list goes on.\n\nMore broadly, bitcoin looks like a way to level the playing field in the realm of international currency. We doubt it will ever replace fiat entirely, because governments will always want the ability to control money. It does seem plausible that bitcoin could serve as a check on fiat currencies, though, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the kinds of inflation we\u2019ve seen in recent years. If bitcoin were to do that alone, it would be a meaningful contribution to the world. But it\u2019s doing much more.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve learned from our peers is that bitcoin is misunderstood not just by boomers but across generations. We\u2019re still early. Having grown up with the internet, we think Gen Z is likely to catch on to bitcoin more quickly than others, but we\u2019re not there yet. So far, it\u2019s not being widely taught in universities, and our peers continue to think of it mostly as speculation. We think that will change in the years to come. Once people go down the bitcoin rabbit hole, we\u2019ve discovered, they tend to like what they see.\n\nThis is a guest post by Seth Cantey, Jack Evans, and Anonymous.

        "content": "Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 price will hinge on regulatory environments, public perception, and institutional adoption.\n\nRegulatory changes will crucially impact Bitcoin\u2019s stability and growth prospects in 2024.\n\nIncreased corporate and institutional engagement is expected to significantly boost Bitcoin\u2019s value.\n\nGlobal economic factors, including inflation and market shifts, will closely influence Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nSince its inception, Bitcoin has been subject to notable price swings, capturing the interest of individual traders, significant investors, and the public alike. The price of Bitcoin can rise significantly, driven by increased adoption, limited supply, and growing institutional interest.\n\nFactors That Affect The Price Of Bitcoin\n\nUnderstanding Bitcoin volatility and discovery requires insight into several critical aspects that impact Bitcoin price movement. Key factors that contribute to Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility include:\n\nBitcoin Regulatory Environment\n\nGovernment stances significantly affect Bitcoin\u2019s path. Positive and clear regulations can enhance investor trust and lead to growth, while strict rules or prohibitions can cause instability.\n\nPublic Perception Of Crypto\n\nHow Bitcoin is viewed by the public, influenced by media, influential figures, and overall market behavior, can significantly affect its value.\n\nCorporate And Institutional Engagement\n\nAs more prominent businesses and financial entities adopt and utilize cryptocurrency, it lends greater legitimacy and potentially boosts its value.\n\nGlobal Economic Factors\n\nWorldwide economic conditions, including inflation, recessions, and stock market shifts, often parallel impact Bitcoin\u2019s valuation.\n\nSupply-Demand Dynamics\n\nLike any traded asset, Bitcoin\u2019s value is influenced by supply and demand. The halving events diminish the available supply and could push prices up, especially if demand remains consistent.\n\nWhat Will Bitcoin Be Worth In 2024? Experts\u2019 Insights\n\nSeveral experts in the field, both individual and institutional, are bullish on the price of Bitcoin moving into the year 2024. These forecasts can be seen below:\n\nCathie Wood | CEO Ark Invest | $600K\n\nCathie Wood of ARK Invest predicts Bitcoin could reach $650,000 in 2024 to $1.5 million by 2030, with her optimism spawning from a potential spot Bitcoin ETF and Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature, contrasting with centralized entities like FTX.\n\nThis prediction entails a crypto market cap representing over half of a projected $25 trillion total crypto market, emphasizing Bitcoin\u2019s role as a unique global digital monetary system.\n\nMike Novogratz | CEO Galaxy Digital | $500K\n\nMike Novogratz, a prominent Bitcoin advocate and CEO of Galaxy Digital, has significantly revised his earlier bullish predictions for Bitcoin.\n\nIn 2021, he had anticipated Bitcoin reaching $500,000 by 2024, even planning a commemorative tattoo for the milestone. Novogratz maintains a long-term optimistic view, believing Bitcoin will eventually hit $500,000, though not within the next five years.\n\nHis current outlook is influenced by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s firm stance on interest rates, which Novogratz has forecasted as a barrier to a rapid return to Bitcoin\u2019s previous highs.\n\nTim Draper | Billionaire Investor | $250K\n\nBillionaire investor Tim Draper, known for his early advocacy of cryptocurrency, has adjusted his prediction for Bitcoin\u2019s value. Initially, Draper forecasted that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by June 2023.\n\nHowever, he recently acknowledged that this target might be delayed until 2025, attributing the postponement to unexpected aggressive enforcement actions by the U.S. government, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), against crypto companies.\n\nDraper remains optimistic about Bitcoin\u2019s value and underlying technology, envisioning a future where financial transactions and operations are conducted entirely in Bitcoin, leveraging blockchain\u2019s transparency and efficiency.\n\nMax Keiser | American Broadcaster | $220K\n\nMax Keiser, a seasoned financial broadcaster and Bitcoin advocate, has long been known for his outspoken and sometimes controversial predictions.\n\nKeiser\u2019s unique insights into Bitcoin\u2019s price movements and broader global economic implications provide a thought-provoking perspective. Max advocated for Bitcoin when it was just $1 and has been one of the earliest adopters and most influential figures in the space.\n\nFundstrat | Research Firm | $180K\n\nFundstrat, a prominent research firm, has set an ambitious target for Bitcoin, predicting it could soar to $180,000 by its 2024 halving.\n\nThis forecast is based on two major factors being: the potential launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the historical influence of previous halving events on Bitcoin\u2019s price.\n\nFundstrat\u2019s projection reflects a bullish stance on Bitcoin\u2019s future, buoyed by these significant market developments and anticipated changes in the cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nStandard Chartered | Investment Bank | $120K\n\nStandard Chartered has revised its Bitcoin price forecast, now estimating it will hit $50,000 by the close of 2023 and then escalate to $120,000 by the end of 2024.\n\nThis projection represents an upward revision from the bank\u2019s earlier forecast, which anticipated Bitcoin reaching a value of $100,000 by the conclusion of 2024, showcasing an increasingly optimistic view of Bitcoin\u2019s market potential in the next few years.\n\nRobert Koyosaki | Author Investor | $120K\n\nNumerous well-known individuals have forecasted that Bitcoin will eventually reach $100,000.\n\nAmong them is Robert Kiyosaki, the American investor and author of \u201cRich Dad, Poor Dad,\u201d who predicts a potential surge in Bitcoin\u2019s price to $120,000 by 2024, driven by a decline in the U.S. dollar.\n\nAdam Back | Computer Scientist | $100K\n\nAdam Back, renowned as a pioneering figure in the Bitcoin community, projects that the cryptocurrency will hit the $100,000 mark by March 31, 2024.\n\nHis prediction considers the pivotal role of Bitcoin miners and the anticipated impact of the upcoming halving event. According to Back, this event, set to reduce the reward for mining Bitcoin transactions, could propel its value close to $100K, setting the stage for a significant milestone in Bitcoin\u2019s valuation journey.\n\nJesse Myers | OnRamp Capital | $100K\n\nJesse Myers of OnRamp Capital believes that Bitcoin will surpass the $100,000 mark only after the 2024 block subsidy halving.\n\nHe anticipates that it will take the market between a year to 18 months to fully adjust to the effects of the halving. This perspective suggests a more gradual increase in Bitcoin\u2019s value, following the pattern set by the significant event in the cryptocurrency\u2019s ecosystem, which alters the rate at which new Bitcoins are generated.\n\nArthur Hayes | CEO BitMEx | $70K\n\nBitMEX\u2019s founder, Arthur Hayes, envisions Bitcoin potentially reaching $70,000 by 2024 amid a more conservative short-term outlook.\n\nHe predicts a significant surge in Bitcoin\u2019s value, with a long-term projection of $750,000 to $1 million by 2026. In his recent interview , Hayes pointed to Bitcoin\u2019s limited supply, the introduction of Bitcoin spot ETFs in regulated markets, and geopolitical uncertainties as significant factors driving this anticipated growth.\n\nHe underscored the importance of Bitcoin\u2019s capped supply at 21 million coins, which he believes will fuel demand. Additionally, Hayes anticipates a bullish trend across all asset markets, influenced by central bank policies.\n\nWhile his predictions for the near future are modest, with Bitcoin possibly hovering around $38,000 this year, his long-term forecast is notably optimistic.\n\nBerenberg | Investment Bank | $56.6K\n\nThe investment bank Berenberg has updated its forecast for Bitcoin, setting a target of $56,630 for April 2024. This revised prediction is shaped by the anticipated 2024 Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to impact the supply dynamics significantly and increase interest from institutional investors.\n\nConsidering these key market developments, Berenberg\u2019s projection reflects a cautious yet optimistic outlook on Bitcoin\u2019s future.\n\nJP Morgan | Investment Bank | $45K\n\nJP Morgan analysts predict Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $45,000 in 2024, a slight premium to its current trading price. Bitcoin trades at $38,000 (at the time of writing), approximately 20% below JP Morgan\u2019s forecast.\n\nThis bullish outlook is partly based on the belief that investors see Bitcoin as interchangeable with gold and also considers the impact of the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for next April or May. This represents a notable change in the narrative around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe price of Bitcoin in 2024 is expected to be influenced by regulatory policies, public perception, institutional adoption, global economic conditions, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\nExpert predictions vary, with estimates ranging from $45,000 to $600,000. These projections reflect optimism about Bitcoin\u2019s future amid challenges in a dynamic market, highlighting its potential growth and continued relevance in the financial landscape.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat factors will influence Bitcoin\u2019s price in 2024?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s 2024 price will be shaped by regulatory environments, public perception, corporate engagement, global economics, and supply-demand dynamics.\n\nHow will regulatory changes impact Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nGovernment regulations will significantly affect Bitcoin\u2019s stability and growth in 2024, with clear policies potentially boosting investor trust.\n\nWhat Role will institutional adoption play in Bitcoin\u2019s 2024 valuation?\n\nBitcoin\u2019s value in 2024 could rise with increased corporate and institutional engagement, lending legitimacy and boosting its value.\n\nHow might global economic factors affect Bitcoin in 2024?\n\nWorldwide economic conditions, including inflation and market shifts, will likely parallel Bitcoin\u2019s valuation in 2024."
