        "content": "AP\n\nBitcoin plunged about 10% after it was revealed that SpaceX sold the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that SpaceX wrote down the value of bitcoin it owns by $373 million.\n\nThe recent jump in bond yields to 16-year highs has weighed on risk assets overall, including crypto.\n\nThe price of bitcoin plunged about 10% hours after it was revealed that Elon Musk's SpaceX sold the cryptocurrency.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that SpaceX, which first purchased bitcoin in 2021, wrote down the value of its bitcoin holdings by a total of $373 million in 2021 and 2022 and has sold the crypto.\n\nThe write-down coincides with a steep drop in bitcoin's price, which crashed in late 2021, setting off a \"crypto winter\" that extended through most of 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla made similar moves with bitcoin. Last year, the company disclosed that it sold most of its bitcoin holdings after acquiring it in 2021.\n\nFollowing the WSJ report, which cited SpaceX financial documents, the price of bitcoin plunged about 8% to about $26,500, and has since further decline to about $26,200. The price of bitcoin is down 11% over the past week, trading at levels last seen in mid-June.\n\nThe jump in bond yields has also been weighing on risk assets overall, including crypto. On Thursday, the 10-year Treasury yield hit the highest level since 2007 amid indications the Federal Reserve remains hawkish on rates.\n\nPrior to the recent slide, bitcoin had been trading in a sideways range for months as investors held out hope for the potential SEC approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, with applications from big-name financial institutions like BlackRock.\n\nFundstrat's Tom Lee has argued that a potential bitcoin ETF approval could send the cryptocurrency to new highs above the $100,000 level.\n\nBut the SEC has yet to show any indication that an approval is imminent, and more recently has delayed action on several bitcoin ETF applications.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider"

        "content": "Hong Kong introduced new regulations for exchanges in June, following years of uncertainty about crypto.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped the creation of a vibrant crypto culture.\n\nThe metropolis teems with crypto storefronts offering over-the-counter trading in Bitcoin, Ether, and altcoins.\n\nSome days it seems like everyone in Hong Kong has a crypto story.\n\nThe son of the security guard in my apartment block bought three restaurants with money made from Bitcoin investments. I tell a Romanian importer at a bar that I write about crypto and he pulls up the leg of his jeans to reveal a Bitcoin tattoo on his calf. A medical student at Hong Kong University tells me her friends made \u201cso much money\u201d trading tokens \u2014 but she knows little about crypto herself.\n\nSigns of Bitcoin and its ilk are, quite literally, everywhere in this metropolis of 7 million. An environmental group advertises its NFT collection on a billboard by the Star Ferry terminal where you cross to Hong Kong Island from Kowloon.\n\nCrypto crazed\n\nThe crypto scene in Hong Kong these days is striking, given the existential levels of angst now rippling through the industry.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nIt\u2019s true, Bitcoin is up more than 60% this year and ETH has jumped 40%, but with US regulators clamping down on the likes of Coinbase and Binance, and DeFi regularly roiled by hacks and heists there\u2019s an unmissable vibe that the revolution is in trouble. So why is Hong Kong so crypto crazed?\n\nBitcoin and Ethereum ATMs still abound in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Shutterstock\n\nHard to say, but the evidence is ample. Walking through Central, the city\u2019s business district, on a Saturday night, there\u2019s a sign by the mid-level escalators for Bitcino, \u201cwhere Bitcoin meets casino and drinks.\u201d\n\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club\u2019s ApeFest is coming to Hong Kong later this year. Convenience stores stock an NFT magazine created by local enthusiasts. The app I use to top up my phone credit shills the metaverse at me.\n\nNOW READ: Why Lebanon just can\u2019t quit Justin Sun\u2019s Tron \u2014 it\u2019s \u2018100% mixed up\u2019 with Tether\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nIn contrast to other cities, where it isn\u2019t easy to find crypto-related things, in Hong Kong they\u2019re hard to avoid. You might find the occasional cafe in Singapore with an Azuki on the wall or countries like Thailand that give you NFTs when you visit certain tourist spots, but Hong Kong is next level.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that not too long ago there was a perception that crypto was dead in Hong Kong.\n\nIn 2021, Henri Arslanian, former chair of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong, told The Financial Times that every large crypto company in the city had \u201calready started a contingency plan to relocate their business due to the uncertainty.\u201d He moved his firm, Nine Blocks Capital, to Dubai last year.\n\nThen the Hong Kong\u2019s Securities and Futures Commission announced plans to regulate exchanges. In June, the city launched a task force for promoting web3. Politicians including Johnny Ng are staking their reputations on this being the future in the city.\n\nCreative mashups of Bitcoin and other forms of recreation are plentiful in Hong Kong. Photocredit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nWhy Hong Kong changed its mind about crypto is still not clear. Some put it down to improved understanding among regulators. Some say the government got a case of FOMO as Singapore and Dubai started trying to coax away their companies.\n\nStill others say it\u2019s the guiding hand of Beijing \u2014 though, given China\u2019s hard line on crypto, this raises more questions than it answers. Beijing, after all, has banned speculating on tokens and mining Bitcoin.\n\nBut perhaps the strangest thing you may notice in Hong Kong is how many over-the-counter crypto shops there are.\n\n\u2018Call Me Bitcoin Queen\u2019\n\nForeign exchange outlets on Nathan Road now sit side by side with booths bearing names like Crypto King. The T symbol for Tether hangs at the entrance to Chungking Mansions, a notorious 60-year-old tower block that houses an eclectic collection of hostels, rent-by-the-hour rooms, phone repair shops, currency traders, fake watch sellers, doss houses, and cheap curry kitchens. Now it\u2019s added crypto to its list of amenities.\n\nThe forex and remittance shops are still more popular than their crypto counterparts \u2014 one shopkeeper rolls his eyes when I ask about his crypto neighbour \u2014 but occasionally a person saunters over to one of the crypto desks.\n\nWant some USDT and fast food? Bored Garden sells both. Photo credit: Callan Quinn/ DL News\n\nThe crypto shops are far more audacious than their forex counterparts. The crypto shop Coiner ran an ad campaign in 2021 featuring photos of the founder, Priscilla Ng, and the caption \u201cCall Me Bitcoin Queen\u201d (perhaps an unfortunate choice of title given the \u201cCryptoqueen\u201d moniker often attached to OneCoin fraudster Ruja Ignatova).\n\nLaunched three years ago, Coiner has three branches in Hong Kong, one of which also doubles as an art gallery for NFTs. It\u2019s not even the biggest player in terms of branches. Another competitor, One Satoshi, has nine.\n\nBitcoin orange\n\nMeanwhile, Bored Garden is probably one of the only businesses in the world that sells both Tether\u2019s USDT stablecoins and hamburgers. The Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed restaurant in Central doubles as an over-the-counter shop. Like Coiner, it has a fondness for using Bitcoin orange.\n\nWhen it comes to crypto in Hong Kong, it\u2019s hard to pin down your typical user and their motivations, a staff member at one shop tells me. But they can offer some insights. Tether is more popular than Bitcoin and Ether. Customers aren\u2019t necessarily tech savvy \u2014 several shops have run educational programs in the past to teach people about crypto.\n\nNOW READ: Hong Kong regulators say crypto firms lie about submitting licence applications\n\nAnd a lot of customers come from mainland China, particularly since the border opened earlier this year.\n\nHong Kong has long been the first port of call for Chinese citizens wishing to get their money out of China. In theory, you can only move out $50,000 per person, per year. This has led to some convoluted schemes for moving money involving gold, jewellery and even strapping wads of cash to your body to pass through customs.\n\nCoiner is one of many OTC shops that are doing business in Hong Kong's revived crypto scene. Photocredit: Coiner\n\nTen years ago, I used to hear stories about taking money through the border by buying necklaces in Shenzhen and then trading them for cash at a sister shop in Hong Kong. It might have been an urban legend, but it demonstrates the desire a lot of people have to get their funds out of the country. Despite the ban in China, crypto remains a popular way to do so.\n\nThis popularity with mainland visitors may become an issue for storefront crypto businesses. Some now refuse to take mainland customers, citing the crypto ban in China. Scrutiny of crypto is ramping up: From January to April, more than 675 crypto scams were reported to police, involving some HK$416.6 million ($53.2 million).\n\nRegulatory changes\n\nAs exchanges face regulatory changes that will allow them to operate compliantly in the city while servicing retail customers, little has been said about OTC trading. Yet facilitating the purchase of cryptocurrency for mainland citizens is unlikely to be allowed to continue long-term.\n\nFor now, the crypto party is back in full swing.\n\nAt the Central Market, I get to chatting with someone who runs an NFT fashion company. A devotee of Hedera Hashgraph, a crypto network, chews my ear off for 30 minutes about how it\u2019s a superior technology to traditional blockchain.\n\nInvariably, people ask me what token they should invest in next. I reply that I don\u2019t have a clue.\n\nCallan Quinn, DL News\u2019 Hong Kong correspondent, covers the crypto industry in Asia. Have a tip? Contact the author at callan@dlnews.com."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nJudge grants SEC request to file motion for appeal in Ripple case\n\nJudge Analisa Torres has granted a request from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in its case against Ripple Labs. The decision allowed the SEC to file a motion, on Aug. 18, requesting permission to bring a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Ripple will also be able to file an opposition to the motion. Torres ruled, on July 13, that Ripple\u2019s XRP token is not a security when distributed in public sales, but the ruling considered XRP a security in institutional sales. The case against Ripple has been ongoing since December 2020, when the SEC sued Ripple and its executives over allegations of offering an unregistered security.\n\nBitcoin, Ether price slump leads to crypto bloodbath with $1B in liquidations\n\nThe Bitcoin and Ether price slide on Aug. 18 saw the top two cryptocurrencies fall to a two-month low and triggered a series of liquidations for thousands of derivative traders. The crypto bloodbath led to billions of dollars worth of hedged positions being liquidated, and several traders lost millions of dollars in a single trade. According to CoinGlass data, a total of 176,752 traders got liquidated within hours, indicating a rapid rise in price volatility just days after BTC and ETH recorded their lowest daily volatility in several years. The price function in the crypto market was attributed to several factors, including the SpaceX Bitcoin write-down and macroeconomic factors.\n\nBitcoin-friendly El Salvador sees bond returns soar to 70% in 2023\n\nEl Salvador, which adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender in 2021, has seen its dollar bond outperform the majority of the emerging markets with a 70% return in 2023. The massive rally of the bond has now drawn interest from several institutional giants, including JP Morgan, Eaton Vance and PGIM Fixed Income, prompting President Nayib Bukele to say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d Apart from the institutional giants, the likes of Lord Abbett & Co LLC, Neuberger Berman Group LLC and UBS Group AG have also added debt security since April.
