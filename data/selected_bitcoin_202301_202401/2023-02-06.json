        "content": "Meanwhile, ether fell as low as $1,610.21 Monday. It was last higher by 1.7% at $1,646.12.\n\nFor the month, bitcoin is down 0.4%. However, it's still up 39.1% for 2023.\n\nBitcoin fell as low as $22,655 early Monday morning, its lowest level since Jan. 31, according to Coin Metrics, after breaking through the $24,000 on Thursday. It was last trading higher by less than 1% at $23,001.58.\n\nThe price of bitcoin dipped below $23,000 over the weekend as investors digested the latest U.S. employment numbers and looked toward a batch of Federal Reserve member speeches.\n\nA strong labor market\n\n\"Bitcoin continues to lose its momentum after the stronger-than-expected January jobs report forced the market to prepare for two more rate hikes,\" said Yuya Hasegawa, crypto market analyst at Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitbank.\n\n\"Bitcoin has survived a week packed with important events and economic data, while maintaining the price around $23,000, but the market may have exhausted reasons to buy the coin and could be subjected to profit-taking sell orders this week,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, the Labor Department reported the strongest gain in nonfarm payrolls \u2013 517,000, for the month of January, far higher than the 187,000 Dow Jones estimate \u2013 since July and a 53-year low in the unemployment rate. After the numbers were released, Treasury yields rose and the U.S. dollar index followed \u2013 both of which tend to move inversely to crypto.\n\nThe report \"delivered a blow to all those expecting the Fed to cut rates soon,\" said Noelle Acheson, economist and writer of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter. \"The bump in employment, and the lowering of the official unemployment rate to the lowest in over 50 years, suggests that scenario is a way off still, and reminds the market that the Fed has no other reason to bring rates down.\"\n\n\"Expectations are shifting to more tightening, and higher rates for longer (what the Fed has been saying all along), which is not good for risk-on assets,\" she added.\n\nAwaiting a crypto pullback\n\nFor several investors and analysts, the crypto market is showing a bullish trend, and likely found a bottom at $17,000 in December, but is likely to pause at least once more before taking off on a more meaningful bull run.\n\nBitcoin is trading \"at the deepest overbought condition in over two years\" and is \"due for a brake check,\" according to Wolfe Research.\n\nMany believe that the macro environment will continue to be a big challenge for risk assets including crypto. In 2022, crypto's correlation with stocks was at its highest and that trend isn't likely to be over.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Washington D.C. Economic Club on Tuesday, and several other Fed members are slated to deliver speeches this week.\n\n\"Given last week's failure to fully suppress the market's optimistic rate outlook, the Fed members will likely continue to remind the market that the Federal Funds rate will climb above 5% and will be kept there throughout the year,\" Hasegawa said."

Read preview\n\nA fashion executive in Hong Kong who thought she was adopting a kitten from Thailand was tricked into giving scammers more than $764,000 in Bitcoin, local authorities said on Wednesday.\n\nThe would-be cat adopter, a 58-year-old vice-president of a fashion company, believed she had contacted someone looking to give away a three-month-old kitten, The South China Morning Post reported.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.\n\nShe got in touch online with the unnamed person in April and continued communicating with them over WhatsApp, per the outlet.\n\nThe executive was told she could receive the kitten for free, but that she would have to pay transport and insurance fees via cryptocurrency, per a case briefing the Hong Kong Police Force sent to Insider.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe complied, opening a cryptocurrency account and sending the funds to the accused scammer's e-wallet, the authorities said.\n\nThen, the woman was fed a tall tale that the cat had died during the shipping process. At the same time, another unnamed individual posing as a foreign bank employee contacted her, saying she would be compensated for the cat's death with an insurance payout of around $150,000, police said, per the briefing.\n\nThere was just one catch: The executive would have to make another payment, this time as a guarantee or administration fee, according to police.\n\nShe followed the instructions, and by the time she realized the entire interaction was a scam, she'd bought $764,574 worth of cryptocurrency and sent it all to the fraudster, the authorities said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe total sum was transferred over 40 Bitcoin transactions between July and November. It was only in January that the executive thought something was amiss and reported her case to the police, the SCMP reported, citing an anonymous source familiar with the matter.\n\nNo one has been arrested in connection to the case yet, police said.\n\nCrypto scams have surged worldwide in the last few years, with losses in 2021 totaling almost 60 times that of losses recorded in 2018, the Federal Trade Commission reported in June. Scammers made off with around $1 billion in crypto in 2021 alone, per the FTC.\n\nBlockchain analysis firm Chainalysis reported a higher estimate for that year, saying $14 billion was taken by crypto scammers in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPets are often in the mix, too. In April, New Zealand authorities warned of scammers selling puppies using photos they found online, asking potential buyers to transfer more than $1,200 in crypto for purchasing, transport, vaccination, or insurance fees.\n\nIn 2018, Bitcoin scammers targeted owners of lost dogs in North Carolina, demanding ransoms for the animals when they didn't have the pets in their possession."

        "content": "This news release constitutes a \"designated news release\" for the purposes of the Company's prospectus supplement dated September 2, 2022 to its amended and restated short form base shelf prospectus dated January 4, 2022.\n\nVancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - February 7, 2023) - HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. (TSXV: HIVE) (Nasdaq: HIVE) (FSE: HBFA) (the \"Company\" or \"HIVE\") is pleased to announce the production figures from the Company's global Bitcoin operations for the month of January 2023, with 260 Bitcoin produced in January, plus USD $180,000 of income from grid balancing, and a current BTC HODL balance of approximately 2,430 Bitcoin mined with green energy, representing an approximate 20% year over year growth (2,043 Bitcoin HODL in Jan 2022). The Company notes its year over year monthly production in January 2023 is consistent, during a period where BTC mining difficulty has gone up approximately 60%. Additionally, HIVE does not have any equipment financing or BTC backed loans.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/153904_841d0965f4f91ba0_001full.jpg\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\n\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/5335/153904_841d0965f4f91ba0_002full.jpg\n\nSummary Overview:\n\nHIVE produced 260 Bitcoin in the month of January, from ASIC and GPU mining operations, representing an average of 110 Bitcoin Per Exahash. A 21% month over month increase, compared to December 2022 (214 Bitcoin produced).\n\nHIVE's year over year monthly Bitcoin production was consistent (260 Bitcoin in January 2023 and 264 Bitcoin in January 2022), during a period where the Bitcoin network difficulty increased approximately 60%.\n\nHIVE earned USD $180,000 in income from balancing the grid, in addition to Bitcoin produced in January. Based on the daily Bitcoin prices during the month of January, the income from grid balancing would equate to a mined value of 10 Bitcoin.\n\nHIVE deployed over 6,700 new generation ASIC miners in its data centers, representing one of the largest upgrades in the Company's history, to improve our gross mining margin and fleet efficiency.\n\nHIVE has deployed over 3,200 BuzzMiners in its facilities in Sweden and Canada. These miners are from the 5,655 BuzzMiners manufactured, tested, and received to date.\n\nHIVE has fully deployed all the 3,570 S19j Pro miners acquired in December 2022 into our New Brunswick and Lachute facilities. As a result of in-house software improvements by HIVE's technical team, we further increased our efficiency at our New Brunswick site by approximately 20% in average J/TH efficiency.\n\nHIVE expects to receive an additional 645 BuzzMiners in the next 2 months, representing a total production quantity of 6,300 BuzzMiners powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC for the initial production run. HIVE is the first company in the world to commercially deploy thousands of its own Bitcoin ASIC miners powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC.\n\nHIVE sells all of the Bitcoin earned from our GPU mining hashrate, with a focus to HODL the green Bitcoin mined from ASICs.\n\nStory continues\n\nJanuary 2023 Production Figures\n\nFrank Holmes, Executive Chairman of HIVE stated, \"We are very happy to have overcome several big headwinds over the past year such has Bitcoin prices falling 50%, the Global Difficulty surging 50% which means fewer coins mined unless you increase both the efficiency of ASIC chips and number of machines mining which HIVE has done. Even with huge headwinds like the FTX bankruptcy and contagion, the HIVE management team has stayed focused and increased its BTC production and our HODL Bitcoin position. Further we have pivoted with our GPU chips away from Ethereum after the Merge and are using Ai to mine alternative coins and convert into Bitcoin, thus we are able to generate Bitcoin revenue. We have decided to sell the BTC earned using GPU/Ai and strive to HODL our Bitcoins created from hydro and geothermal electricity. We have not been using our ATM since November 30, 2022, and have been able to create other sources of revenue from balancing the grid to selling back energy while deploying the new Intel BuzzMiners and purchased other highly efficient ASIC machines from internal cash management. Our financial success has been from our company's values, culture, and strategy to have propriety software and strong global partnerships. Finally and fortunately we never borrowed at predatory 12-18% interest rates or kept our Bitcoin in crypto exchanges and I am very proud of the team's agility to adapt thoughtfully and quickly to the many external crisis's through the crypto winter bear market of 2022.\"\n\nAydin Kilic, President & CEO of HIVE noted \"We are proud to be producing 260 Bitcoin while also earning over USD $180,000 this month from our grid balancing initiatives. Our team has deployed over 6,700 ASIC miners in our data centers, including over 3,200 HIVE BuzzMiners, powered by the Intel Blockscale ASIC and all of the 3,570 S19j Pros we acquired in December 2022. HIVE was the first public crypto mining company to realize income from its grid balancing program in Sweden. We view grid balancing as part of our core strategy, and whenever possible, we seek to hedge energy prices.\"\n\nMr. Kilic continued, \"We have increased our overall hashrate by 25% month over month from December 2022 to January 2023. We are continuously looking to optimize our allocation of energy as a resource, either to generate hashrate or sell energy back to the grid. Moreover, if unhedged spot prices are uneconomical in a specific jurisdiction, we quickly scale down our production. Additionally, our remaining GPU fleet is now generating approximately USD $80/MWHR in revenue, which is similar to the USD $/MWHR compared to Bitcoin ASIC miners in the current Bitcoin mining economics. We are constantly optimizing the deployment of our technology resources as a company to optimize profit. These advancements and agility allow us to generate positive gross mining margin during a crypto mining bear market. With a strong balance sheet of over USD $56 million of Bitcoin, HIVE is well positioned in the market today.\"\n\nThe Company's total Bitcoin production in January 2023 was:\n\n260 BTC produced;\n\n8.4 BTC produced per day on average;\n\n2.68 Exahash of BTC Hashrate (BTC ASIC hashrate plus BTC GPU Hashrate) as of January 31, 2023 comprised of 2.52 Exahash of ASIC BTC hashrate and 0.16 Exahash of GPU BTC Hashrate (the GPU fleet was curtailed to earn income for grid balancing) as of January 31 st ; and\n\nMonthly average of 2.37 Exahash, which is equal to 110 Bitcoin per Exahash, comprised of an average of 2.28 Exahash of ASIC mining capacity and an average of 90 PH/s of Bitcoin GPU mining capacity during the month.\n\nBitcoin HODL Update\n\nAs of the date of this press release, HIVE has approximately 2,430 Bitcoin, with a market value of over USD $56 million.\n\nBitcoin Global Network Mining Difficulty Is Volatile\n\nNetwork difficulty factors are a significant variable in the Company's gross profit margins. The Bitcoin network difficulty was 34.1T as at January 1, 2023 and increased to 39.4T as at January 31, 2023. Accordingly, Bitcoin mining difficulty ended the month about 15% higher than the beginning of the month.\n\nThe Bitcoin Network Difficulty is a publicly available statistic, that reflects the total number of Bitcoin miners online and is important in analyzing a company's gross profit margins, and number of Bitcoin produced. This data is available on many websites, here is one citation: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty\n\nAs more people mine Bitcoin (difficulty increases), the daily Bitcoin block reward which presently is fixed at 900 Bitcoin per day, gets split amongst more miners; thus each miner receives a smaller portion of the block reward. Conversely, as Bitcoin prices fall, many miners may lose money, and power down, thus taking their hashrate off the network, causing Network Difficulty to decrease.\n\nThose miners with the lowest costs of production; by virtue of having more efficient machines and/or lower energy costs, are able to continue their production during these volatile cycles. Not all miners will continuously mine during a given month. As a result, some miners will produce less Bitcoin than expected, relative to their advertised hashrate. For the foregoing reasons, HIVE will self-curtail part of its operations if the unhedged spot energy prices are uneconomical, thereby leaving part of its total gross hashrate unutilized.\n\nAll Bitcoin miners are striving to use the most efficient Bitcoin ASIC chips, and we are happy that we have been able to upgrade our global fleet during this crypto market downturn.\n\nATM Equity Program Update\n\nEffective as of the date hereof, the Company has terminated its at-the-market equity distribution agreement under which the Company had the option to sell up to USD $100 million of common shares of the Company at its discretion (the \"ATM Equity Program\"). The Company did not offer any shares under the ATM Equity Program after November 30, 2022. From inception of the ATM Equity Program to November 30, 2022, the Company issued 1,306,474 common shares (the \"ATM Shares\") for gross proceeds of USD $3,941,736. The ATM Shares were sold at prevailing market prices. A cash commission of USD $118,252 on aggregate gross proceeds from the ATM Equity Program was paid to the Company's sales agent.\n\nAbout HIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd.\n\nHIVE Blockchain Technologies Ltd. went public in 2017 as the first cryptocurrency mining company with a green energy and ESG strategy.\n\nHIVE is a growth-oriented technology stock in the emergent blockchain industry. As a company whose shares trade on a major stock exchange, we are building a bridge between the digital currency and blockchain sector and traditional capital markets. HIVE owns state-of-the-art, green energy-powered data centre facilities in Canada, Sweden, and Iceland, where we endeavour to source green energy to mine digital assets such as Bitcoin on the cloud. Since the beginning of 2021, HIVE has held in secure storage the majority of its treasury of ETH and BTC derived from mining rewards. Our shares provide investors with exposure to the operating margins of digital currency mining, as well as a portfolio of Bitcoin. Because HIVE also owns hard assets such as data centers and advanced multi-use servers, we believe our shares offer investors an attractive way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWe encourage you to visit HIVE's YouTube channel here to learn more about HIVE.\n\nFor more information and to register to HIVE's mailing list, please visit www.HIVEblockchain.com.
