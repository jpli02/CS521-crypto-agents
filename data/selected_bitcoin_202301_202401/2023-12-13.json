        "content": "Needham analyst John Todaro had a Buy rating on Coinbase Global, Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) with a price target of $160. Todaro had a Hold rating on Robinhood Markets, Inc (NASDAQ: HOOD).\n\nThe analyst surveyed over 20 financial and wealth advisors (RIAs), 75 Coinbase users, and over 200 individuals to determine who would buy a bitcoin ETF if approved and whether they would prefer bitcoin exposure via an ETF, bitcoin-linked stocks, trusts, or buying bitcoin directly on a crypto platform such as Coinbase and Robinhood.\n\nTodaro's survey results indicate that RIAs currently have limited bitcoin offerings for their clients; the majority answered their current bitcoin strategy is to guide clients to buy directly via crypto exchange (25%), crypto stocks (15%), or GBTC (10%), but most would favor an ETF if one existed, the majority of advisors expect 5-10% of their clients to own a bitcoin ETF is available in 2024 and 2025.\n\nAdvisors are seeing mostly disinterest from clients around bitcoin and an ETF, but nearly all expect interest to pick up if bitcoin prices continue to increase.\n\nTodaro's survey results found that anyone who has not already purchased Bitcoin is unlikely to buy a Bitcoin ETF. Only 11% of respondents who have not previously owned bitcoin described themselves as very likely or somewhat likely to buy a bitcoin ETF.\n\nTodaro's results indicate that an ETF launch is unlikely to bring in more capital flows unless this coincides with higher bitcoin prices/and other engagements, which spurs greater retail interest in the asset.\n\nAmong individuals who have owned bitcoin, respondents slightly preferred to buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange/platform than a prospective ETF through an equity brokerage, although this is age-dependent.\n\n40% would choose to purchase an ETF, while 49% preferred using a crypto platform, which suggests that an ETF will unlikely cannibalize COIN's higher-margin trading business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Actions: COIN shares traded higher by 5.56% at $147.30 on the last check Wednesday.

        "title": "3 Solid Stocks to Buy as Bitcoin Looks Poised for 2024 Rally - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies have rallied this year, and the bull run is expected to continue into 2024 as investor sentiment remains high. Although Bitcoin (BTC), the world\u2019s most prominent cryptocurrency, has declined more than 5% since Dec 11, it is still trading above the $41,000 mark.\n\nLast week, Bitcoin rallied briefly above $44,000 before hovering around the $42,000 mark on renewed optimism. On Dec 12, it surged above $42,000 briefly, following the release of the consumer price index (CPI) data before settling slightly above $41,000.\n\nLast year saw the crypto market taking a hit, primarily because of a couple of unfortunate events, namely the FTX bankruptcy following a major fraud and the Tera Luna crash.\n\nHowever, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB (BNB) have staged a solid rebound this year. Year to date, Bitcoin has rallied more than 147%, while Ethereum, Cardano and Dogecoin have rallied 80.8%, 125.6% and 29.7%, respectively.\n\nThe rally continued for the first seven months of the year before stalling in August as investors failed to get a clear picture of the Federal Reserve\u2019s next course of action on interest rate hikes.\n\nAn increase in interest rates usually has a detrimental effect on growth-oriented sectors, which include technology, consumer discretionary industries and cryptocurrencies.\n\nHowever, the rally resumed in late October on renewed optimism that a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval for a Bitcoin ETF is on the anvil. This could play a key role in giving the crypto market a fresh boost.\n\nInvestors are presently anticipating the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the SEC, with expectations for this approval in as early as the first half of 2024.\n\nAlso, inflation has been steadily declining over the past several months. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.1% year over year in November, slower than October\u2019s jump of 3.2%. This has raised hopes that the Fed may likely end its monetary tightening campaign soon and start cutting rates in the first half of 2024, which definitely bodes well for the crypto market.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Choices\n\nBlock Inc. SQ is an online digital and mobile payment platform for consumers and merchants and is the parent company of Square and Cash App. The users of Cash App can buy, sell, send and receive Bitcoin.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the best bitcoin stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our discussion on the bitcoin industry, head directly to 5 Best Bitcoin Stocks To Invest In.\n\nIn November this year, bitcoin reached new highs and other top cryptocurrencies also experienced gains. The spike in cryptocurrency investments is attributed to the expectation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) potentially approving the first spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund (ETF) on a major U.S. exchange. At the same time, global regulators including the SEC are actively cracking down on digital assets, targeting crypto exchanges and high-profile executives such as Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Changpeng Zhao of Binance. However, with the historic settlement imposed by the U.S. Department of Justice on Binance, the cryptocurrency industry can potentially bring an end to a series of scandals and issues, according to Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:COIN). Armstrong commented during an interview with CNBC\u2019s Joumanna Bercetche:\n\n\u201cThe enforcement action against Binance, that\u2019s allowing us to kind of turn the page on that and hopefully close that chapter of history. There are many crypto companies that are helping build the crypto economy and change our financial system globally. But many of them are still small startups. I think that regulatory clarity is going to help bring in more investment, especially from institutions.\"\n\nDon't Miss: 11 Most Profitable Cryptocurrency Stocks\n\nExperts in the cryptocurrency space predict a new bullish phase, as an increasing number of individuals express expectations for bitcoin to reach record levels in 2024, surpassing $100,000. Bitcoin has experienced a surge of over 120% in 2023, leading to widespread optimism that this momentum will persist into 2024. Pascal Gauthier, CEO of Ledger, told CNBC recently:\n\n\u201cIt feels that [2023] was a year to get ready for the bull run that is yet to come. But the sentiment is very hopeful for [2024] and 25.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Vijay Ayyar, who serves as the vice president of international markets at the cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX, shared with CNBC:\n\n\u201cA number of market participants are expecting a bull run some time after the halving, but given the ETF news, we could very well have a run before that leaving most investors on the sidelines. That could cause a massive upward run in the price.\u201d\n\nSee also: 12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds\n\nOn another positive note, Robinhood Markets, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD) is expanding its cryptocurrency trading feature to the European Union, aiming to tap into international markets for growth. The new crypto product enables customers to trade over 25 tokens, including popular ones like bitcoin, ether, ripple, cardano, solana, and polkadot. Robinhood plans to add more tokens and introduce features such as transfer and \"staking\" for earning crypto rewards in 2024. This move follows the company's recent announcement about launching stock trades for U.K. customers by early 2024, with a waitlist already open and promising yields of up to 5% on deposits.\n\nAt the end of October 2023, Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani expressed optimism about a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and said that the price of bitcoin could consequently reach $150,000 by 2025. The positive projection is approximately five times the present price and over twice the previous all-time high for bitcoin in November 2021. Chhugani also expects that the approval of the ETF would result in the allocation of up to 10% of bitcoin's circulating supply to ETFs. This approval would enable traditional investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin through their investment portfolios.\n\nNevertheless, there are still individuals who heavily criticize cryptocurrencies. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon on December 6 strongly criticized bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, stating during a Senate Banking Committee hearing that he has always been vehemently against crypto. Dimon expressed the view that cryptocurrencies should be banned, emphasizing concerns about their primary utility being linked to criminal activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, and drug trafficking. Despite his stance against cryptocurrencies, it's noteworthy that JPMorgan is actively engaged in blockchain, the underlying technology supporting the $1.6 trillion crypto industry.\n\nSome of the best crypto stocks include CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ).
