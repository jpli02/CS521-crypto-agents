        "content": "An ER doctor and crypto entrepreneur has been found dead in Arkansas\u2014more than a week after he went missing in Missouri.\n\nDr. John Forsyth was the founder of Onfo, which promised to offer users decentralized cryptocurrency that could be earned through network mining.\n\nAnd back in 2020, a Forbes profile named him as a \"Bitcoin millionaire\" who had found fortune as an early adopter during his math degree\u2014holding on to his crypto through multiple halvings.\n\nDr. Forsyth's day job was working in the emergency room of Mercy Hospital in Cassville, Mo., but loved ones raised the alarm after he had failed to turn up for a shift on May 21.\n\nHis younger brother Richard\u2014who was also involved in Onfo\u2014told The Daily Beast: \"He wouldn't miss a shift even if his eyeballs were hanging out of their sockets. It was an immediate red flag.\"\n\nFrom 'Bitcoin Billionaires' to SEC Charges: A Brief Crypto History of the Winklevoss Twins\n\nFears grew for the welfare of the 49-year-old, a father of seven, when his wallet, passport, and briefcase were found in his unlocked car near a 90-acre aquatic park. Dr. Forsyth's cell phones were also abandoned inside an RV he often parked outside the hospital so he could be close to his patients.\n\nSearches by law enforcement had spanned a nine-mile radius\u2014with loved ones desperately appealing for information on his whereabouts.\n\nSouth African Crypto Founders Vanish, $3.6 Billion Allegedly Missing\n\n\"My brother has now been missing for a week. I'm grieving, I'm afraid, and it feels like the world has tipped into sheer chaos,\" his sister Tiffany Andelin Forsyth wrote on Facebook on Monday. \"I'm so afraid he's just gone. Please don't let this be how this ends. The hole that will leave in my life will be empty forever.\"\n\nDr. Forsyth's brother said his divorce had recently been finalized and he was newly engaged. On Facebook, his fianc\u00e9e described him as the love of her life.\n\nRichard added that\u2014while he and his brother had \"made some enemies\" in the crypto space\u2014nothing had seemed unusual in the run-up to his disappearance.\n\nLocal media has reported that Forsyth's body was discovered with an apparent gunshot wound in a lake in northwest Arkansas. The police are yet to provide further details on the circumstances surrounding Dr. Forsyth's death\u2014but say foul play does not appear to be a factor."

        "content": "Bitcoin and Ether fell during Wednesday afternoon trading hours in Hong Kong, along with the majority of the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Bitcoin recorded the day\u2019s largest loss, followed by Litecoin. XRP stood out as the sole gainer.\n\nSee related article: Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin weighed down by debt ceiling uncertainty\n\nBitcoin, Ether down, along with all cryptos except XRP\n\nBitcoin fell 1.81% from 10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong to US$27,163. The afternoon slump positioned the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency as the greatest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies over the past 24 hours, experiencing a 2.31% loss. Litecoin followed closely, falling 2.27% to US$89.51.\n\n\u201cBitcoin needs to overcome the US$28,000 big figure. It\u2019s weekly candle has to close above US$28,000 to be bullish,\u201d said Johnny Louey, a crypto research analyst at trading platform LiquidityTech Protocol.\n\nEther fell 1.31% to US$1,870 since 10:00 am, falling under the psychological benchmark of US$1,900.\n\nXRP was the only token in the green among the top 10 cryptos, rising 0.91% to US$0.5074 after leading yesterday\u2019s gains. The coin started picking up momentum after pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton tweeted on Sunday, that the court will make public internal documents from 2018 showing former Securities and Exchange Commission director William Hinman saying sales of Ether tokens were not securities transactions, which could undermine the regulator\u2019s case against Ripple Labs. The U.S. securities watchdog sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in December 2020, claiming that XRP was a security and that Ripple had conducted unregistered securities transactions by selling the cryptocurrency.\n\nBitcoin, Ether NFT sales up\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index inched up 0.02% to 3,412.59 points in the 24 hours to 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong while rising 1.0% during the week.\n\nStory continues\n\nBitcoin\u2019s secondary non-fungible token (NFT) sales rose 5.42% to US$4.6 million in the past 24 hours. Interest in Bitcoin NFTs is surging, after the new BRC-721E token standard was launched on Monday. The token standard allow Ethereum-native ERC-721 NFTs to be permanently transferred to Bitcoin, where they become BRC-721E tokens.\n\nThe launch of the new Bitcoin-based token standard has pushed the Milday Maker NFT collection to the top 10 for daily sales. Originally founded on Ethereum, Miladay Maker participated in the creation of the BRC-721E token standard.\n\nEthereum\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 10.25% to US$19.1 million, boosted by Bored Ape Yacht Club, which rose 1.32%, generating US$2.6 million in sales for the network. Sales for Opepen Edition NFTs also rose 79.15% to US$868,963.\n\nAmong Forkast Labs NFT indexes, the Forkast CAR NFT Composite was the only one to decrease, falling 2.07% to 1,019.54 points. Cardano\u2019s 24-hour NFT sales rose 12.47% to US$385,305, according to CryptoSlam.\n\nAsian Equities, U.S. stock futures down, ahead of debt ceiling updates\n\nThe committee approved the bipartisan deal with a narrow 7-6 vote, where it faced opposition from two Republicans and four Democrats. Image:Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nAsian equities weakened during Wednesday afternoon trading, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index falling 1.94% near its six-month low. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 experienced a 1.41% decrease, while the Shanghai Composite inched down 0.61% and the Shenzhen Component Index dipped 0.70%.\n\nConcerns over China\u2019s economic recovery impacted investor sentiment, as the country\u2019s manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index fell to a five-month low in May. The data suggests that factory activity contracted more rapidly than anticipated due to diminishing demand, leading to the offshore yuan depreciating to US$7.12 per dollar, its lowest value in six months.\n\nU.S. stock futures were also red as of 4:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, as investors awaited updates on the U.S. debt ceiling deal. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.15%, the S&P 500 futures index inched down 0.18%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 futures weakened by 0.18%.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy reached a preliminary deal on Sunday, that would suspend the debt ceiling until after the presidential election in 2024. While the bill passed through the House rules committee by a 7-6 margin on Tuesday, it still needs approval from the full House, which is set to vote on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department moved the date at which the U.S. would reach its borrowing limit to June 5.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index rose 0.33% to 104.5 points on Wednesday, on track for a monthly gain of nearly 3%. Meanwhile, the euro fell 0.53% to US$1.06, its lowest since March 17.\n\nSee related article: Hong Kong Solidifies Crypto Regulations even as Malaysia bears down on Huobi\n\n(Update edits headline, adds equity and NFT sections)"

        "title": "How Low Will Bitcoin Go? Dogecoin Turning Bullish And Big Eyes Coin's Journey To Pioneering Innovations - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, new concepts and trends are continuously emerging, piquing the curiosity of both investors and crypto enthusiasts. One aspect attracting attention is the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency itself, particularly meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), and the eagerly anticipated Big Eyes Coin (BIG). The cryptocurrency community is now experiencing a level of excitement that has never been seen before.\n\nUnveiling The Cryptic Chessboard: Bitcoin\u2019s Fate Hangs In The Balance\n\nBitcoin markets showed modest gains as traders sought stability above $28,000, reaching a two-week high of over $28,450. Short-term profit-taking sentiment pushed the price lower to around $27,850. However, Bitcoin remained up about 10% from its recent low of $26,000 on May 25. The gains were fueled by optimism around the U.S. averting a default after an agreement to raise borrowing limits. The weakened U.S. dollar contributed to Bitcoin\u2019s rise, with a potential rally to $31,000 in June, representing a 10% increase from current levels.\n\nGlassnode\u2019s Checkmate study highlights the significant impact of short-term holders (STH) on Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory. Metrics like STH-MVRV, STH-SOPR, and profit/loss ratios are closely monitored. Inactive holders hinder price objectives, while active participation inspires confidence. STH\u2019s actions carry substantial influence, shaping the market. Analysts track these metrics diligently, expecting retracements in the 2023 bull market. Bitcoin bulls must showcase unwavering dedication to price increases. Ultimately, market players collectively shape Bitcoin\u2019s path forward.\n\nDogecoin\u2019s Meme Magic: From Viral Phenomenon To Bullish Potential\n\nThe original meme coin, Dogecoin, captivated the crypto community with its appeal to online culture and celebrity endorsements. It swiftly garnered popularity and a devoted group after being influenced by the well-known Doge meme. Dogecoin gained acceptance as a payment option on websites like Reddit and Twitch despite having little practical purpose.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen examining its recent activity, Dogecoin made a breakout from a bullish falling wedge but then retracted. A double-bottom pattern with significant buying pressure, however, formed and suggested probable bullishness. A positive short-term prognosis is further supported by the wave count and RSI readings. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate that $0.087 to $0.091 could act as resistance during a pullback. However, a price decline below $0.069 would continue the bearish trend and can result in a price of $0.050.\n\nBig Eyes Coin: Weaving Utility To Meme Coins\n\nBe prepared for an exciting show as Kitty Cuddlers gets ready for the highly anticipated Big Eyes Coin presale finale on June 3. As a result of the brave foray into the world of online casinos and P2E adventures that have enchanted the public, hearts are racing in anticipation of the grand launch on June 15, 2023. A gripping shift is coming for BIG with the thrilling return of the Stage 3 price of $0.00017. Everyone will be on the edge of their seats as a result of the frenzy of interest and anticipation this comeback will generate.\n\nThe ERC-20 cryptocurrency Big Eyes Coin emerges as a pioneer in the decentralized exchange (DEX) industry with its ground-breaking platform, BIG Swap. Prepare yourself for a tsunami of excitement. From the beginning, this innovative company has enchanted its customers with unique products like the captivating BIG Loot Box Trading Cards and alluring promo codes that promise a plethora of advantages. The meme coin has accomplished a great deal by raising an incredible $46 million during its initial coin offering (ICO) and is currently just $5.5 million away from meeting its audacious $51.5 million hard ceiling. The story of BIG has never ceased to enthrall and astound, igniting the passion of both investors and enthusiasts.\n\nBIG has established a vibrant, adorable community. BIG was able to successfully establish itself in the midst of the glut of Doge-themed meme coins, demonstrating to the world that we could carve out a unique niche for ourselves without following the crowd. Additionally, BIG has created its very own online BIG casino, which will exclusively benefit our devoted BIG holders.\n\nBig Eyes Coin will also grow to be a top Play-to-Earn project in the web3 and cryptocurrency sectors!

Buy Big Eyes Coin immediately because once $BIG is gone, these low prices are never coming again!\n\nThe Final Say\n\nThe fate of Bitcoin remains uncertain, influenced by short-term holders and market dynamics. Dogecoin shows bullish potential, while Big Eyes Coin\u2019s presale finale sparks excitement in the decentralized exchange industry. The crypto world is brimming with anticipation and opportunity.\n\nFind out more about Big Eyes Coin (BIG) at:\n\nPresale: https://buy.bigeyes.space/\n\nWebsite: https://bigeyes.space/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/BigEyesCoin/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/BigEyesCoin"
