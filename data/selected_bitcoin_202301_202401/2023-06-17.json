        "content": "The decoupling became even more pronounced in Q2 2023 as the price trajectories diverged.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s volatility increased following the recent legal actions on crypto behemoths.\n\nBitcoin [BTC] formed an inverse relationship with tech stocks as sentiment around virtual assets and equities diverged lately.\n\nIs your portfolio green? Check out the Bitcoin Profit Calculator\n\nA Twitter user, citing data from on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that Bitcoin\u2019s 30-day correlation coefficient with popular indices like Nasdaq and S&P 500 turned negative. In essence, this meant that when the price of BTC goes up, the price of the equities will fall and vice versa.\n\n? Look out folks, something's changing! Stocks and crypto are now mostly negatively correlated, meaning as one thrives, the other dives. Data from @intotheblock https://t.co/THDanxmnii pic.twitter.com/lXl7eHOhvt \u2014 Elite ?? (@eliteXBT) June 16, 2023\n\n\u201cDigital gold\u201d is finally here\n\nProponents of Bitcoin have long positioned it as the \u201csafe-haven asset,\u201d or an investment whose value is expected to be steady or even rise during economic downturns, similar to precious metals like Gold.\n\nTo be seen as an inflation hedge by investors, an asset must display significant decoupling from traditional markets. However, with the growing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and other altcoins became more and more influenced by the geo-political and macroeconomic triggers that affect the mainstream market.\n\nBut this has started to change. The spate of banking collapses in March led investors to put their funds in the crypto market. Following this, the world\u2019s largest crypto by market cap, Bitcoin soared 52% until hitting its yearly peak in April, as per IntoTheBlock. On the other hand, equity indices were largely flat until that point.\n\nThe decoupling became even more pronounced in Q2 2023, as the crypto market in general and Bitcoin in particular entered a consolidation phase. The king coin fell even more as regulators in the United States became increasingly hostile.\n\nHowever, the tech stocks went the other way, resulting in a clear divergence in the growth trajectories of the two assets.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the equity markets with which BTC started to insulate itself. In recent months, the \u201cdigital gold\u201d has shown increased decoupling from its real-world counterpart, Gold [XAU] as well. Bitcoin grew faster in value than the precious metal since the banking crisis of March.\n\nHow much are 1,10,100 BTCs worth today?\n\nVolatility starts to rise\n\nBTC exchanged hands at $26,561.18 at the time of writing. The coin gained nearly 4% in the last 24 hours, as per Santiment. Interestingly, after witnessing a protracted period of low volatility, BTC began to live up to its image of an unpredictable asset lately. The volatility increased following the recent legal actions on crypto behemoths by regulators."

        "content": "Top Stories This Week\n\nUS lawmakers file \u2018SEC Stabilization Act\u2019 to fire Gary Gensler\n\nUnited States Representative Warren Davidson has introduced the \u201cSEC Stabilization Act\u201d into the House of Representatives. One of the bill\u2019s main provisions is to fire Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler. The bill would remove Gensler from office and redistribute power between the SEC chair and commissioners. It would also add a sixth commissioner to the agency, disallow any party from holding a majority on the commission and create an executive director position. The SEC declined to comment on the matter.\n\nBlackRock applies for spot Bitcoin ETF \u2014 a US first if approved\n\nBlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investment company, has filed an application for a Bitcoin spot exchange traded fund (ETF). It would be the first crypto spot ETF in the United States, if it receives approval. According to the filing, Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund and Bank of New York Mellon would custody its fiat. The SEC has not approved a spot Bitcoin ETF so far despite numerous applicants. The world\u2019s first spot traded Bitcoin ETF was Canada\u2019s Purpose Bitcoin ETF, set up in early 2021.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao denies rumors of selling Bitcoin to bolster BNB\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng \u201cCZ\u201d Zhao has refuted accusations that Binance has been secretly selling Bitcoin (BTC) to artificially stabilize the price of its BNB token. The rumors have come from several market commentators in the past days, accusing the exchange of intentionally manipulating the market to artificially inflate the value of BNB. CZ said that Binance had not sold any of its BTC or BNB, adding that the crypto exchange still held \u201ca bag\u201d of FTX Token \u2014 the native token of the now-defunct crypto exchange FTX.\n\nSEC\u2019s Gensler says BTC, ETH \u2018not securities\u2019 in a newly surfaced video\n\nA newly surfaced video from 2018 featuring Gary Gensler has made the rounds on social media, showing the now-chair of the U.S. securities regulator again stating that multiple cryptocurrencies are not securities. \u201cOver 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They\u2019re not securities,\u201d Gensler says in the video, which is understood to come from a 2018 event hosted by Bloomberg for institutional investors. At the time, Gensler was a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The video contrasts with his more recent actions as the chair of the SEC.\n\nBinance\u200b.US hires former SEC enforcement official amid lawsuit\n\nFormer SEC enforcement official George Canellos has reportedly been hired by Binance.US as part of the legal team defending the company against allegations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. In response to the SEC\u2019s action on June 5, Binance.US announced the suspension of U.S. dollar deposits and the potential pausing of fiat withdrawals, citing \u201cextremely aggressive and intimidating tactics\u201d from regulators. On Twitter, a former SEC chief said the exchange is \u201cclearly preparing for a criminal prosecution and continuing to hire the best defense attorneys in the world.\u201d\n\nWinners and Losers\n\nAt the end of the week, Bitcoin (BTC) is at $26,349, Ether (ETH) at $1,716 and XRP at $0.47.

The 4% plunge came as the Federal Reserve pressed a pause on interest rates but suggesting more hikes would come later this year.\n\nOn short timeframes for BTC/USD, traders are remaining cautious amid the risk of further downside to come. \u201cStill in the area of interest, but need to sustain above $24.5K to avoid a cascade to $23k,\u201d wrote Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe, founder and CEO of trading firm Eight.\n\nFUD of the Week\n\nCurve pool imbalance triggers USDT depeg concerns, Tether CTO calls it FUD\n\nThe Tether (USDT) stablecoin slightly deviated from its U.S dollar peg on June 15 due to an imbalance in Curve\u2019s 3pool. The price of USDT fell by 0.3% to around 0.997 as its weightage in the Curve 3pool increased to over 70% from the usual 33.1%. A significant rise in the weightage of a stablecoin in the pool indicates heavy selling of that asset. Tether\u2019s chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, took to Twitter to assure that the depeg is nothing to worry about and it is ready to redeem any amount.\n\nBoard member Yat Siu answers community concerns on ApeCoin DAO salary payouts\n\nLeaders of the decentralized autonomous organization governing the ApeCoin ecosystem have been criticized by community members for what they described as \u201cinsane\u201d salaries. An organizational chart showed salaries ranging from $7,000 to $75,000 per month, shocking some community members and prompting a slew of inquiries from others. According to a board member, the compensation corresponds to the \u201cresponsibility and liability of the role.\u201d\n\n\u2018Who the hell\u2019 is Prometheum and what did it say to Congress about SEC compliance?\n\nThe relatively under-the-radar crypto company Prometheum has been thrust into the spotlight after a recent testimony from its co-founder, Aaron Kaplan, before a U.S. House Committee discussing crypto regulatory clarity. Kaplan\u2019s testimony advocated for regulating crypto under current securities laws \u2014 a view also shared by the SEC. He argued that multiple frameworks provided by the SEC have \u201cclearly laid out\u201d a \u201ccompliant path forward for crypto,\u201d adding that those arguing for new crypto-specific laws are \u201csimply not willing to comply.\u201d\n\nBest Cointelegraph Features\n\n\u2018Holy shit, I\u2019ve seen that!\u2019 \u2014 Coldie\u2019s Snoop Dogg, Vitalik and McAfee NFTs: NFT Creator\n\nNFT art pioneer Coldie creates crypto culture time capsules about Buffett, Buterin and McAfee \u2014 and writes lyrics for Snoop Dogg.\n\nReal Bedford is the \u201cBitcoin\u201d soccer team that\u2019s made headlines and united BTC evangelists.\n\nAI Eye: Is AI a nuke-level threat?

        "title": "Is Crypto Dead? - The Atlantic",
        "content": "Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against Binance, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, accusing it of mishandling customer funds and a litany of other white-collar crimes. It also charged Coinbase, a public company and the biggest U.S. crypto business, with failing to register as a broker-dealer.\n\nThe government actions did not move the price of bitcoin much, nor did they crater Coinbase stock; traders and investors had been expecting the enforcement actions for months. And both firms vowed to fight the charges and remain operational. Binance \u201cshould not be the subject of an SEC enforcement action, let alone on an emergency basis,\u201d the firm said in a statement. \u201cWe are very confident in the way we run our business\u2014the same business we presented to the SEC in order for us to become a public company,\u201d Paul Grewal, Coinbase\u2019s chief legal officer, said in response.\n\nEven before the SEC announcements, crypto was in trouble. Dozens of firms had failed, millions of individual investors had plunged into the red or cashed out, and billions of dollars of institutional investment had moved on. Beset by long-standing problems of its own invention, the industry now faces not just a regulatory crisis but an existential one too: Is crypto down, or is it dead?\n\nIt is definitely down, written off by thousands of individual and institutional investors. The most obvious issue: scams. In the world of crypto, big firms are scams. Little firms are scams. Stable coins are scams; exchanges are scams; NFT schemes are scams; initial coin offerings are scams; tokens are scams. Firms run by self-proclaimed altruists are scams. Firms run by the shadiest dudes you can possibly imagine are scams. \u201cThere have been a lot of putatively decentralized Web3 companies that were really just three guys and a pair of servers in a pump-and-dump coin scheme,\u201d Will Wilkinson, the head of policy at TBD, a bitcoin-focused subsidiary of the fintech giant Block, told me. And even simple, legitimate crypto activity remains prone to fraud. Hackers purloined nearly $4 billion of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies last year alone, according to the research group Chainalysis.\n\nThe industry also has a complexity problem. Fourteen years since the advent of bitcoin, people still struggle to comprehend how the blockchain works, what Web3 is, and what tokens and coins and NFTs are. Many folks also struggle to figure out how to buy crypto assets and manage their investments. (Why do you need a weird series of letters and numbers to secure your bitcoin, again?)\n\n\u201cA mature market is one that shouldn\u2019t make you afraid to put your money in. You shouldn\u2019t be turning off a bunch of folks with greed and theft,\u201d Yesha Yadav, an expert in financial-market regulation at Vanderbilt University\u2019s law school, told me. \u201cEqually, it should be one in which folks feel comfortable in understanding the technicalities.\u201d\n\nWhat is the point of doing all of this, anyway? Boosters have for years described crypto as a revolutionary technology\u2014disempowering central banks, empowering private individuals, and perhaps even ushering in an era of world peace. But revolutionary for whom and in what way? That\u2019s hard to say. Most crypto users are just making speculative bets; most crypto firms are just making or facilitating speculative bets themselves. Crypto is a casino, for the most part, and one without the free drinks.\n\nThese digital assets are \u201cpretty much only good for illegal activities, like money laundering, narco-terrorism, and tax evasion,\u201d Dennis Kelleher, a co-founder of Better Markets, a nonprofit advocating for financial regulation, told me. \u201cIs there social or public interest in enabling a financial product like that?\u201d\n\nThen there are the volatility and the bubbles. Financial assets go up in price. They go down in price. This is their nature. But few things go up and down quite like crypto. NFTs came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and collapsed. Initial coin offerings came out of nowhere, sucked up billions of dollars, and disappeared.\n\nEven bitcoin\u2014the most stalwart and liquid part of the industry\u2014still sees wild swings in price. Two years ago, the internet and the airwaves were awash with advertisements painting crypto as an investment for the brave, a down payment on the future. These ads targeted everyone, especially Black investors historically shunned by Main Street financial institutions. \u201cI want to ensure that communities like the one I come from are not left behind,\u201d LeBron James said, announcing a multiyear deal with Crypto.com. It was a pump-and-dump on a multibillion-dollar scale. \u201cDumb money\u201d got in to get smart money out. Black money got in to get white money out. The price of bitcoin quintupled. Then it crumbled.\n\nWealthy investors might be able to tolerate these kinds of losses. High-risk investors might be able to tolerate this kind of volatility. So too might crypto true believers, for whom HODL, or \u201cHold on for dear life,\u201d is a common refrain. But most people don\u2019t want to hold on for dear life.\n\nIf these were the only issues, the crypto winter might just be that\u2014a season. The price of bitcoin and ether would recover, as they already are. People would forget about the brazen frauds and the sweaty ads and the endless hacks. New businesses would start; new promises would be made; new money would flow in.\n\nBut for Uncle Sam. From the very beginning, many crypto businesses have been engaged in something called \u201cregulatory entrepreneurship.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cask forgiveness, not permission\u201d as a business model: Start-up founders create a company in probable violation of American law, argue that the law should not apply to them, grow \u201ctoo big to ban,\u201d lobby intensively, and hope for the best. It might sound delusional, but it\u2019s a common strategy in Silicon Valley, one that has worked out for Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, and DraftKings, among others.\n\nFor years, crypto companies argued that American financial regulations do not apply to them because, well, because. They pushed Congress to \u201cclarify\u201d the laws. And while Congress debated whether and how to do so, those firms allowed individual customers to buy, trade, and leverage their newfangled assets. Still, American financial companies abiding by American financial law largely avoided pouring money into or building products with crypto, because of the legal and regulatory risk. Goldman Sachs didn\u2019t start packaging ether into derivatives; Bank of America would not let you pay your mortgage in bitcoin.\n\nThis weird status quo protected the broader American financial system from the fraud and chaos of the crypto markets. But it left individual crypto investors exposed to that fraud and chaos. \u201cWhat makes my blood boil is the fact that actual people have been losing their shirts,\u201d Yadav told me, \u201cwhile we are over here stroking our chins about what exactly these asset classes represent.\u201d\n\nThe collapse in November of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s Bahamian crypto mega-exchange-slash-alleged-Ponzi-scheme, did not destabilize the financial system. But it did kill off the chances of Congress passing crypto-friendly legislation. And while Congress delayed, debated, and walked away, the SEC forged ahead, insisting that most crypto assets are securities, arguing that crypto companies have failed to register their businesses and structure them properly, and promising to force them into compliance. Coinbase and Binance are just the biggest and latest companies targeted; there have been dozens of enforcement actions in the past few years.\n\nCrypto firms complain that this is innovation-stifling \u201cregulation by enforcement\u201d: Congress needs to clarify the rules before the SEC can administer them. \u201cImagine if more than a century ago regulators had cut Ford and General Motors off from banking services because they considered automobiles too risky,\u201d Katie Haun, a prominent crypto investor, wrote in The Wall Street Journal in March. \u201cMajor U.S. policy decisions should be made by Congress and state legislatures, not by unelected officials.\u201d\n\nBut many financial experts argue that the SEC\u2019s authority is obvious. Most crypto assets are securities: \u201can investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others,\u201d as defined in a 1946 Supreme Court case. (Bitcoin, notably, is not a security: Nobody is profiting from the efforts of bitcoin\u2019s leadership, because bitcoin has no leaders.) \u201cThe SEC is trying to enforce the most basic investor protections we have,\u201d Kelleher told me. \u201cTruthfully, these are not aggressive cases. These aren\u2019t close calls.\u201d\n\nTo the crypto industry, they might be devastating, though. Many crypto firms do not have a business model that nets out if standard financial regulations apply\u2014that\u2019s the essence of regulatory entrepreneurship. Coinbase, the SEC alleges, is a jumble of conflicts of interest, one providing insufficient protections and disclosures to its customers and performing shoddy bookkeeping. Were it to restructure, it would likely be a smaller company with higher costs and narrower or even obliterated margins. (The company was profitable before the crypto collapse and is now operating in the red.) Binance is functionally a criminal enterprise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler argues\u2014\u201can extensive web of deception\u201d purposefully evading American law. (The SEC complaint includes a message that Binance\u2019s chief compliance officer sent to a colleague, making Gensler\u2019s case for him: \u201cWe are operating as a fking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA bro.\u201d)\n\nThe risks to those two firms mirror the risks to the crypto industry as a whole. \u201cIt seems like this is just the beginning,\u201d Edward Moya, a crypto analyst, wrote in a note to clients last week, adding that the \u201cregulatory hammer\u201d is swinging and predicting that traders would abandon positions, pull assets off exchanges, and dump speculative investments.\n\nDoes this mean crypto is dead? Yes and no. Crypto boosters\u2019 grandest vision\u2014of digital currencies changing everything, putting the Federal Reserve out of business, supplanting Wall Street and Main Street, and remaking the web as Web3\u2014does seem over. Crypto is a trillion-dollar global asset class. Crypto is also a fringe industry that is offshoring and shrinking and growing more fringe, not one innovating alongside and outcompeting Big Finance.\n\nBut bitcoin and the blockchain are going to stick around, the former a popular alternative investment and a preferred currency of criminals, the latter a curious general-use technology. \u201cThe potential is the same,\u201d Jerry Brito, the executive director of Coin Center, a crypto think tank and advocacy group, told me. Wilkinson, for his part, noted how helpful bitcoin had proved to be in getting money to people without access to strong and stable banking networks: human-rights activists in Ukraine, refugees fleeing climate disasters, families receiving remittances in Ghana and Kenya. Both said they believe the industry would benefit from having the scammy, scummy actors and cheap-and-easy money flushed out. \u201cSome of these projects are potentially revolutionary,\u201d Brito told me. \u201cBut I think a large portion of the ecosystem was completely cynical. That\u2019s not helpful.\u201d\n\nI am still not sure whether many crypto projects are useful, yet alone revolutionary. Surely some use cases are out there waiting to be discovered, but good luck to crypto companies trying to persuade Americans to adopt them going forward. A recent CNBC survey found that 8 percent of adults have a positive view of crypto. A recent Pew survey found that just 2 percent of adults familiar with crypto are \u201cextremely\u201d confident in its safety and reliability. The past two years of price crashes, Ponzi schemes, and stolen funds have not just soured the government on crypto. They have soured the public too."
