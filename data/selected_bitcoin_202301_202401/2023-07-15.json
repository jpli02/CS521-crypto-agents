        "content": "Shares of companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies surged this week as investors cheered a key ruling on one token as a win for the industry.\n\nCoinbase Global, Inc. gained 34% this week, its best performance for the period since mid-March, despite closing 1.6% lower Friday.\n\nOther crypto-linked stocks also had positive weekly performances. Robinhood Markets, Inc. rose 15% this week, its best in nearly a year, and Bakkt Holdings Inc. gained 30%. Bitcoin mining companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings, Hut 8 Mining Corp., Riot Platforms, Inc. and Cipher Mining Inc. also saw weekly gains, even as some sold off Friday.\n\nThursday\u2019s ruling that the Ripple Labs Inc. token is a security when sold to institutional investors \u2014 but not the general public \u2014 was the biggest contributor to gains. The decision added to optimism over Bitcoin ETF applications that lifted investor spirits and Bitcoin earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cThis is a positive read-through to COIN as it sets precedent that crypto token sales through exchanges, at least in the XRP case, did not violate securities laws,\u201d Needham analyst John Todaro wrote in a note, boosting his price target to $120 from $70 on the buy-rated stock. \u201cWe believe this outcome should moderately de-risk the regulatory pressure on the stock.\u201d\n\nOf course, the ruling was specific to Ripple and shouldn\u2019t be hastily applied across the industry, Benjamin Salisbury of Height Capital Markets said in a note.\n\n\u201cWe note that the ruling is specific to facts in this case alone and caution against applying this ruling to the Coinbase lawsuit broadly,\u201d Salisbury said. \u201cWe also expect the SEC to appeal the ruling, given the potential implications for securities laws.\u201d\n\nOutside of regulations, short covering may also be lifting crypto-linked stocks whose 2023 rallies have set up contrarian traders to be squeezed.\n\nIn the last month, short sellers bought back $407 million worth of Coinbase shares to exit their positions, according to data from S3 Partners LLC. This year, Coinbase shorts have paper losses of $2.9 billion, making it the seventh least-profitable short behind Tesla Inc., Nvidia Corp., Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., S3 said."

        "content": "Bitcoin miners will face headwinds as the hash rate reaches new record highs ahead of the upcoming halving event next spring, with volatile electricity costs and competition among miners pushing up the cost of production, according to analysts at global financial giant JP Morgan.\n\nHash rate refers to the computational power used to mine a cryptocurrency. The halving event, which occurs roughly every four years, will reduce miners' rewards by half.\n\n\"The upcoming bitcoin halving event in April/May 2024 could be a stress test for Bitcoin miners,\" writes JP Morgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou and colleagues in the firm's latest Flows and Liquidity report, which the firm shared with Decrypt.\n\n\"[It] would reduce the issuance rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC, implying a reduction in miners\u2019 revenue, effectively increasing Bitcoin\u2019s production cost at the same time,\" the report explains. \"As a result, while Bitcoin halving is seen as having a positive effect on the bitcoin price given the production cost acted historically as a floor, it poses a challenge for bitcoin miners.\"\n\nBerenberg Analysts: Bitcoin 'Could Rally' Near Next Year's Halving Event\n\nAccording to the analysis, and based on a global average cost of electricity of $0.05/kWh, it costs around $20,000 to mine a Bitcoin, which is currently worth around $30,000, per CoinGecko. But JP Morgan said the volatility of the hash rate points to the use of a variety of energy sources, meaning miners with access to lower-priced power have an advantage.\n\nIn fact, the company said, a one-cent increase in the cost per kilowatt hour translates to a $4,300 increase in the cost of Bitcoin production.\n\n\"Post halving this sensitivity would double to $8,600, thus increasing the vulnerability of higher-cost producers,\" the firm noted.\n\nThere has been some good news for miners, however.\n\nVanguard Now Owns $560 Million Worth of Bitcoin Mining Stocks\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Institutional interest in bitcoin mining has provided support to struggling miners, with investments in mining rigs from companies like Galaxy Digital and Grayscale Investments,\" it observed. Galaxy Digital recently acquired a major mining facility from Argo Blockchain, and Grayscale spun off an entity focused on Bitcoin mining hardware.\n\n\"Tether, the world largest stablecoin issuer, also plans an investment in a bitcoin mining site in El Salvador,\" according to the report.\n\nNonetheless, the price of Bitcoin and transaction fees will need to rise significantly to offset the lower block reward.\n\nJP Morgan also observed that \"the decline in hype surrounding cryptocurrencies poses an additional challenge for miners' revenues,\" including \"the decline in the hype around Ordinals.\"\n\nThe number of daily Ordinals inscriptions recently hit an all-time high, but Bitcoin fees did not sustain earlier highs along with them.\n\n\"Going forward, it seems unlikely that the Bitcoin hash rate will continue to rise at the same pace post the April/May 2024 halving event without any sustained rise in the Bitcoin price above its production cost or a large increase in transaction fees that could offset the reduction in issuance rewards,\" JP Morgan concluded."
