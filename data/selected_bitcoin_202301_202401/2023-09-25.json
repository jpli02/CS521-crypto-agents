        "content": "In a move that underscores MicroStrategy's unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, the software company has added 5,445 more BTC to its corporate treasury.\n\nThe latest acquisition, made on September 24, 2023, comes at an average price of approximately $27,053 per Bitcoin, amounting to an investment of $147.3 million.\n\nThis purchase brings MicroStrategy's total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 158,245 BTC, acquired at an average price of around $29,582 per Bitcoin, equivalent to approximately $4.68 billion.\n\nMicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been an outspoken advocate for Bitcoin, touting it as digital gold and emphasizing its role as a strategic treasury reserve asset. This latest acquisition further cements MicroStrategy's position as one of the most prominent institutional investors in Bitcoin.\n\nThe move comes as no surprise to those following MicroStrategy's journey in the world of cryptocurrencies. The company first ventured into Bitcoin investments in August 2020 when it made its initial purchase. Since then, it has continued to accumulate Bitcoin, even using debt to finance some of its acquisitions.\n\nAll the while, Saylor has continued to assert that Bitcoin is \"underestimated\" compared to other crypto market opportunities, as this video from Bitcoin Historian Pete Rizzo shows. Saylor has repeatedly said that altcoins are overvalued and should be sold.\n\nWith the growing recognition of Bitcoin's value as a store of value and a potential hedge against economic uncertainty, it remains to be seen whether more institutions will follow in MicroStrategy's footsteps.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."

        "content": "Bitcoin continued to fall in Monday afternoon trade in Asia, along with Ether and all other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos, except Tron. Toncoin was the biggest loser. Global cryptocurrency markets weakened after the U.S. Federal Reserve at its September meeting indicated another interest rate hike by the end of the year, signaling that rates will remain higher for longer than anticipated.\n\nSee related article: South Korean entertainment firm NHN to build blockchain games on Sui despite local ban\n\nTron only gainer among top 10 cryptos\n\nBitcoin lost 1.44% to US$26,182 in 24 hours to 4 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency was hovering above US$26,500 over the weekend but lost the support level early Monday morning.\n\nEthereum also posted losses, dropping 0.69% to US$1,580 in the past 24 hours and 3.27% on the week. The world\u2019s second largest cryptocurrency fell below the US$1,600 support level for the first time since Thursday.\n\nEIP-4844, also known as the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade, is a proposed Ethereum upgrade that aims to improve the speed and cost-effectiveness of the Ethereum network.\n\nThe average fee on the Ethereum blockchain dropped to around US$1.15 per transaction on Saturday, the lowest level since December 2022, according to blockchain intelligence firm Santiment.\n\n\u201cEthereum generated US$17.9 million in fees last week, the lowest since Dec. 26. Fees have peaked out in May this year and are gradually declining, this continues to be a crucial development for Ether prices. With less than one week left in September, fees are (so far) 50% less than in August,\u201d Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, wrote on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe mostly worry about Ethereum as weak fundamentals plus a lack of hype around the EIP-4844 upgrade (which should come sometime in Q4 2023) could make the blockchain slowly obsolete. Holders do not have unlimited patience and these upgrades are not fast enough and are marginal,\u201d Thielen added.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptos fell except Tron, which rose 0.41% to US$0.08434 in the past 24 hours, and gained 0.53% on the week.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization dropped 1.05% to US$1.04 trillion, while market volume gained 51.52% to US$22.17 billion.\n\nNFT market trade mixed\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nThe Forkast 500 NFT index dropped 0.62% to US$1,953.35 in 24 hours to 7 p.m. in Hong Kong, bringing its weekly losses to 2.82%.\n\nForkast\u2019s Ethereum and Polygon indexes also dropped while Solana index rose.\n\nTotal NFT sales volume gained 6.83% to US$9,746,899, while the number of NFT buyers increased 5.93% to US$48,312, according to CryptoSlam data.\n\nAmong blockchains, the Ethereum network topped rankings, gaining 33.47% to US$4.7 million. Polygon and Mythos blockchains ranked second and third respectively.\n\nPolygon-based DraftKings topped rankings among collections, but dropped 30.06% to US$1.04 million.\n\nMost global equities drop\n\nImage: Envato Elements\n\nMajor Asian equity markets dropped on Monday. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite, the Shenzhen Component Index, South Korea\u2019s Kospi, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng declined, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 strengthened at the end of trading hours.\n\nU.S. stock futures were down as of 8 p.m. in Hong Kong on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, the S&P 500 futures as well as the Nasdaq 100 Futures were all in the red.\n\nThe U.S. central bank on Wednesday kept its interest rates unchanged between 5.25% and 5.5%, but revised its economic projection to indicate one more interest rate hike by the end of 2023. It also projects slower-than-expected rate cuts throughout 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon.com said Monday it will invest as much as US$4 billion in an attempt to become a major player in generative artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s investment into a ChatGPT rival reinforces why almost all investors should have some AI exposure in their investment mix,\u201d Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\u201cThis tech has the potential to disrupt existing industries or create entirely new ones. Early investors are likely to benefit from the exponential growth that often accompanies the adoption of such technologies. As these innovations gain traction, their valuations could skyrocket, resulting in significant returns on investment,\u201d Green added.\n\nEuropean bourses weakened on Monday morning in Europe with the benchmark STOXX 600 and Germany\u2019s DAX 40 lower. Traders continue to assess central bank activities from last week. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, France\u2019s central bank governor, told CNBC that it is \u201cpremature\u201d to bet on an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank.\n\n\u201cWe should remain at this level for a sufficiently long period of time. Betting now on the next cut is probably premature,\u201d de Galhau said.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"

        "title": "Bitcoin, Ether flat; MicroStrategy adds to Bitcoin holdings - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin traded flat below US$26,300 Tuesday morning in Asia. Ether also edged up but remained below the US$1,600 mark. Most other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while recording marginal gains in the past 24 hours, logged losses for the week. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the winners. Cryptos, along with global equities, face pressure from interest rate hike concerns and rising treasury yields. U.S. stock futures were flat during early morning trading in Asia after Wall Street closed higher on Monday. That rise broke a four-day losing streak triggered by hawkishness from the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\nLosses for short-term Bitcoin holders\n\nBitcoin was little changed as of 07:40 a.m. in Hong Kong, trading at US$26,276.60 for a weekly loss of 1.78%, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency dropped to US$26,011.47 on Monday evening, the lowest price since Sept. 13.\n\nEther also remained flat. It edged up 0.35% to US$1,586.87 but is down 3.06% for the past seven days. The token touched a high of US$1,595.84 on early Tuesday morning, but failed to move above the US$1,600 resistance level.\n\n\u201cCryptocurrency market sentiment remains weak, amid declines in global stock markets, a strong dollar and rising yields putting pressure on risk assets,\u201d Hani Abuagla, senior market analyst at online trading broker XTB MENA, said in an emailed comment.\n\n\u201cThe economic policies enacted by central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, have redirected capital towards less risky investments such as government bonds,\u201d said Matteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, in an emailed note.\n\n\u201cThese bonds currently offer an attractive risk/reward ratio, offering a passive income while mitigating portfolio risk,\u201d Greco added.\n\nCiting data from blockchain tracker Glassnode, XTB MENA\u2019s Abuagla noted that over 97.5% of addresses owned by short-term Bitcoin holders are posting losses \u2014 an 11 month high. Short-term holders (STH) are those traders that have bought Bitcoin over the last 155 days.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis may mean that the pressure to sell BTC at a loss in the STH pool may be growing, as evidenced by the previous pattern of on-chain behavior (when the price fell below the average STH purchase price of BTC),\u201d said Abuagla.\n\nMeanwhile, Abuagla said that a drop in Bitcoin prices could be a \u201ccontrary signal\u201d indicating an oversold market. That may present a potential accumulation opportunity for long-term investors, he added.\n\nMicroStrategy, the U.S.-based analytics firm founded by Michael Saylor, revealed on Monday it purchased nearly US$150 million worth of Bitcoin from Aug.1 to Sept. 24 at an average price of about US$27,053 per coin.\n\nAs of Sept. 24, MicroStrategy held around 158,245 bitcoins, which were acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly US$4.68 billion.\n\n\u201cWhile this is bullish and shows continued faith and strong buying pressure, crypto markets didn\u2019t really react. Ironically, MicroStrategy\u2019s buying announcements have historically been followed by mild pull-backs instead of rises, and the crypto space might be cautious about buying,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing happens in an environment where investors are still digesting the Fed\u2019s speech hinting at higher rates for longer, and therefore presumed lower valuations for most risk assets,\u201d added d\u2019Anethan.\n\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted gains for the past 24 hours. Cardano\u2019s ADA led the winners. The token rose 1.10% to US$0.2453 but lost 2.49% for the week.\n\nToncoin was the only top-10 non-stablecoin token to record a 24-hour loss. It dropped 1.83% to US$2.16 for a weekly loss of 10.28%.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization edged up 0.28% in the past 24 hours to US$1.05 trillion, while trading volume rose 40.50% to US$24.94 billion.\n\nU.S. equities drop, China\u2019s property woes continue\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures were trading lower as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. The Nasdaq led the losses with a 0.40% drop. Wall Street closed higher Monday following a sharp decline Friday.\n\nMost major Asian stock indexes were down Tuesday morning. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng, South Korea\u2019s Kospi and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 all dipped. The Kospi led the declines with a 1.14% drop. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.14%.\n\nBoth the S&P and Nasdaq indexes last Friday logged their biggest weekly losses since March. That followed U.S. Federal Reserve comments last week indicating it will keep interest rates higher for longer.\n\nChuck Carlson, chief executive officer at the U.S.-based investment advisor Horizon Investment Services, told Reuters Tuesday that he sees a \u201ctug of war\u201d dynamic playing among investors. There are now two groups, he said. Those concerned by Fed hawkishness and \u201cbulls wondering maybe we have seen the correction and we can start to build from these levels higher.\u201d\n\nKey economic data releases this week include the U.S. second-quarter gross domestic output (GDP) and personal consumption expenditure price index (PCE). Both are expected Thursday. Analysts project an acceleration in U.S. GDP growth and a slowdown in core PCE, according to Investing.com.\n\nThe benchmark U.S. 10-year treasury yield rose on Monday to close at 4.542%. That was the highest closing price since October 2007.\n\nThe Fed meets on Nov. 1 to make its next decision on interest rates. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 81.5% chance of no interest rate hike in November, up from 74.6% on Monday. It also gives a 60.9% chance of another pause in December, up from 59.3% on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the crisis at China\u2019s real estate giant Evergrande Group worsened Monday. The firm\u2019s mainland China unit, Hengda Real Estate Group Co., defaulted on principal and interest payments totaling about US$547 million due Sept. 25. The firm\u2019s shares dropped 21.8% on Monday to their lowest closing level since Sept. 5.\n\nEvergrande filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in August 2023 after its default on a dollar bond in December 2021 triggered widespread turmoil in the Chinese real estate industry.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)"
