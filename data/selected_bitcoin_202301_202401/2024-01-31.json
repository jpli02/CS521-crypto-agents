Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market cap declined 0.61% to around $1.65 trillion in the last 24 hours.All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates today, widely anticipated to stay the same. Maintaining this price until month-end would signify Bitcoin's fifth consecutive monthly gain, its lengthiest positive streak. This is likely to continue until Bitcoin halving takes place, said Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex.Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, \"The crypto market is in a wait-and-watch mode as the Fed meeting on the first interest rate decision of 2024 is underway. A decision to cut the interest rate will boost market liquidity and spark economic activity across sectors. Bitcoin is well-positioned to start another growth cycle owing to positive macroeconomic factors.\"In today's trade, altcoins such as BNB , Solana, XRP , Cardano, Avalanche, Dogecoin , Polkadot, Toncoin, Internet Computer and Shiba Inu declined 2-4%. While Tron, Chainlink, and Polygon rose 1-5%.The total volume in DeFi is currently $5.02 billion, 8.73% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume. The volume of all stablecoins is now $52.85 billion, which is 91.83% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.In the last 24 hours, the market cap of Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped to $842 billion. Bitcoin's dominance is currently 51.02%, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC volume in the last 24 hours surged marginally to $22.7 billion.\"BTC has maintained stability, hovering around $43,000.

        "title": "Ether takes center stage as bitcoin heads into one of strongest months - CNBC",
        "content": "Ether is ready to take the limelight in the month ahead after bitcoin and newly launched bitcoin exchange-traded funds dominated crypto investor attention in January. Both bitcoin and ether are on pace to finish the month higher by 0.01%, according to Coin Metrics. January saw sharp price swings driven first by hype before the launch of the first spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., and subsequent flows into and out of the funds after they began trading Jan. 11. By now, the outflows have tapered off and bitcoin's outlook for the year is still strong, boosted by the upcoming halving and the potential for rate cuts. As investors came to expect slow, steady flows into bitcoin through newly institutionalized ETFs in coming months, ether and altcoins have been ready for a breakout. \"Short-term flow has been dominated by GBTC [Grayscale Bitcoin] sales. \u2026 As that flow is easing, the market has found its footing and the reality of a world where large asset managers promote crypto actively is starting to hit home,\" said Darius Tabatabai, co-founder at decentralized exchange Vertex Protocol. \"ETH and the alts are acting as high beta plays on this trend and our expectation is that both will outperform as more focus starts to direct towards ETH rolling out upgrades to [the Ethereum network] \u2026 as well as a potential ETF approval.\" February is a historically strong month for both bitcoin and ether. Bitcoin has finished nine of the last 11 Februarys in the green and has had an average return of 13.12% for the month, according to CoinGlass. Ether has finished the month higher in six of the last seven since its inception, giving it an average February gain of 12.97%. Soon after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot bitcoin ETFs for trading, investors took profits and rotated into ether, pushing it to a 20-month high as they looked ahead to what might come next. The SEC is due to give decisions on spot ETH ETF applications beginning in May. BlackRock, Invesco, Ark and VanEck are among the firms in line for approval, as well as Grayscale, which is seeking to convert its existing Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. Standard Chartered said in a note this week that ahead of the May decision, it expects ether to track or outperform bitcoin's pre-ETF uptrend in the comparable period. If it does, it could reach $4,000 by then, the bank added, which would equal a roughly 70% increase from current levels. \"Bitcoin remains the more popular macro asset with cross-over appeal to traditional finance, and Solana is gaining popularity as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum,\" said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Arca. \"Nonetheless, Ethereum is not going away anytime soon, and it could even compete with Bitcoin if an ETF is approved, or if bitcoin investors realize they want exposure to areas of blockchain's growth that Bitcoin doesn't offer, such as stablecoins, NFTs, [decentralized finance], gaming [and] AI.\" Ethereum is continually improving and upgrading , Dorman added, which will help the network grow in line with cheaper and faster alternatives such as Solana. Its next big update, called \"Dencun,\" is expected to take place in February and is meant to make transactions on so-called Layer 2 solutions \u2014 networks that sit on top of a base network like Ethereum and exist to provide extra capacity and functionality to the network \u2014 less expensive. Ether is also poised to benefit from the popularity of altcoins , many of which run on top of the Ethereum blockchain, according to Jason Urban, the global head of trading at Galaxy Digital. \"We've seen an uptick in alt interest. \u2026 ETH is probably more poised to benefit from that\" than bitcoin, he said. \"There are going to be people that will manifest that play, especially more [traditional finance] people that might not have access or the ability to trade a bag of alts. You'll see that manifest in ETH.\" For January, ETH is heading to a less than 1% gain, while other alts are a mixed bag. Since Jan. 23, however, when bitcoin fell below $40,000 for the first time this year, they've rallied, while ETH has been stagnant. ETH is weaker during that period, while SOL has gained 14%, Polygon's MATIC rose 4% and the tokens tied to Chainlink and Cardano advanced 4% and 3%, respectively. \"If you believe in a bullish market trend like in 2020 and 2021, then it makes sense to invest in the 'fastest horse,' which are the smaller and cheaper blockchains and applications,\" Dorman said. \u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

        "title": "Bitcoin's price history: 2009 to 2024 - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "In this article\n\nJanuary 2009 \u2013 July 2013: Bitcoin gets started\n\nAugust 2013 \u2013 December 2017: Bitcoin draws in the public\n\nJanuary 2018 \u2013 December 2020: Bitcoin recovers and soars\n\nJanuary 2021 \u2013 December 2023: Bitcoin gets hit by regulations and rising rates\n\nJanuary 2024: Bitcoin ETFs debut\n\nBitcoin returns by year\n\nCaret Down Caret Up\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price has been on a roller coaster ride since it first debuted in January 2009, but the long-term trajectory has been higher \u2013 \u201cup and to the right,\u201d as they say. Bitcoin ushered in the age of cryptocurrency, but it took quite a while before the public sat up and took notice.\n\nStill, in little more than a decade, cryptocurrency, and in particular, Bitcoin, has become one of the most exciting trading opportunities in a long time. Bitcoin trading has created millionaires, though given that persistent rise since its debut, plenty of traders would have done fine just holding \u2013 or HODLing \u2013 on for the ride, as many long-term bullish owners have done.\n\nDespite the long-term rise, Bitcoin has been dogged by periods where it\u2019s fallen precipitously. The most recent has been from November 2021 through 2022, when the prospect of rising interest rates and reduced liquidity in the financial markets sent Bitcoin\u2019s price much lower.\n\nBitcoin was unleashed in the months after the global financial crisis obliterated economies. It was created by a mysterious individual or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, and early proponents touted the currency\u2019s promise of moving monetary policy out of the hands of governments and central banks and into an autonomously managed system.\n\nBitcoin famously has a maximum of 21 million coins that can ever be created. In the face of this fixed supply, an ever-increasing demand can send the cryptocurrency soaring. Given these dynamics, speculators have rushed into the space to take advantage of the anticipated price appreciation.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is notoriously driven by sentiment. When the market shifts to its \u201cgreed\u201d phase, Bitcoin soars amid the utopian promises and speculators dismiss the risks of an asset that generates no cash flow. In the \u201cfear\u201d phase, Bitcoin\u2019s price seems to find no traction, as sellers push its price lower amid bad news or general market malaise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid all of this speculation, however, it\u2019s important to remember that Bitcoin is tough to use for everyday purchases. Major companies that introduced ways to pay with Bitcoin have quietly walked back those initiatives. Now the market has rewritten the narrative from Bitcoin as a medium of exchange to one where it\u2019s a store of value, \u201cdigital gold.\u201d However, gold has a few thousand years of history as a store of value, compared to little more than a dozen for Bitcoin.\n\nHere\u2019s how the price of Bitcoin has risen and fallen over time as well as some of the trends driving those moves.\n\nJanuary 2009 \u2013 July 2013: Bitcoin is created and attracts techies\n\nThe New Liberty Standard Exchange recorded the first exchange of Bitcoin for dollars in late 2009. Users on the BitcoinTalk forum traded 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02 via PayPal, making the first price mediated through an exchange a bargain basement price of $0.00099 per bitcoin. In other words, the price was about one-tenth of one cent.\n\nWhile Bitcoin was officially launched on January 3, 2009, it\u2019s tough to find any standard pricing before mid-2010. That\u2019s because there weren\u2019t exchanges in the same way that there are today. However, data became available in July 2010 and continues to this day.\n\nIt was in 2010 that the most expensive pizzas of all time were purchased. One Bitcoin owner offered 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas, an offer that continues to live on in Bitcoin lore. It\u2019s considered the first time that anyone used virtual currency to buy something in the real world.\n\nAccording to historical data at Investing.com, Bitcoin\u2019s price never broke above $0.40 per bitcoin in 2010 but did manage to hit that level in early 2011. Then in February, it crossed $1. Just a few months later, in May, it briefly exceeded $8 \u2013 a stunning 8-bagger in mere months!\n\nBy June 2011, Bitcoin\u2019s price had hit nearly $30, a seemingly unimaginable rise from just months before. And that\u2019s where it topped out for the year. Bitcoin spent the remainder of 2011 just dwindling to as low as $2, before finishing the year at $4.70. After this bubble burst and a more than 90 percent fall from its all-time high, it might have seemed as if the Bitcoin fad was over.\n\nIn 2012, Bitcoin spent much of the year consolidating, slowly growing stronger throughout the year. In November 2012, Bitcoin went through its first \u201chalving,\u201d a change in the reward structure for miners, where they receive half as many bitcoins for mining blocks on the blockchain. As 2012 came to an end, Bitcoin finished at $13.50, just off the highs for the year.\n\nThat consolidation set up Bitcoin for a strong run in 2013 when it began to attract more notice outside a niche audience of techies and hobbyists. The world\u2019s first Bitcoin ATM was installed in Vancouver, allowing buyers to change fiat money for crypto. By the end of January, Bitcoin\u2019s price had already risen to more than $20. The momentum built from there, as interest spread.\n\nBy early March, Bitcoin had already doubled again, rising to more than $40. A couple of weeks later it surpassed $50, and then days later $60. It climbed to $70 the day after that. By the start of April 2013, Bitcoin had passed $100 in breathtaking fashion. Then eight days later it spiked to $230!\n\nFrom there, it was just a week until Bitcoin was back at $68, as the bottom fell out. But then a week later, it had doubled again and traded north of $150. After the strong trading action in April and May, Bitcoin spent June and July settling down. Surely this was the peak of insanity for Bitcoin volatility.\n\nAugust 2013 \u2013 December 2017: Bitcoin breaks through to popular consciousness\n\nAfter months of consolidating from its rise earlier in the year, Bitcoin reached new heights in November 2013. Priced at $213 entering the month, Bitcoin doubled to nearly $435 just 12 days later. By the end of the month, it had nearly tripled from there, up to more than $1,200, before ending the year at $805, a real downdraft, but still up from just $541 a couple of weeks before. Late in the year, the People\u2019s Bank of China banned financial institutions from using bitcoins.\n\nThe year 2014 saw Bitcoin retain its signature volatility. After hitting $1,000 in early January, Bitcoin bottomed at $111.60 on Feb. 21 \u2013 a decline approaching 90 percent! Behind the turbulence were problems at Mt. Gox, one of the earliest crypto exchanges. The exchange had stopped withdrawals, then filed for bankruptcy after losing 744,400 bitcoins of users\u2019 funds.\n\nThen a mere five days later, Bitcoin recorded a price of $593.10 \u2013 more than a 5-bagger in days! Bitcoin spent the rest of the year gradually declining and closed 2014 at about $318.\n\nThe year 2015 started with Bitcoin declining, but most of the year was a slow uptrend, unusual for Bitcoin, and it ended the year at $430. In November, the official Bitcoin B symbol was adopted.\n\nThe first half of 2016 continued the same, with relatively muted volatility and price consolidation. But by the end of May, the price was picking up and by mid-June, Bitcoin was hitting $700. It didn\u2019t last, though, and Bitcoin was back in the $600s until November 2016. It peaked back over $700 and then quickly $800 and $900. As the year ended, Bitcoin was flirting with $1,000, a level it broke through in early 2017, a watershed year for Bitcoin when it came to national awareness.\n\nThe year 2017 started off slowly enough, with Bitcoin wavering between $1,000 and $1,200. But by late April, the digital currency was clearly moving higher. The end of May saw Bitcoin at $2,300, but despite a move higher, it was back below $2,000 by mid-July. The decline didn\u2019t last. By mid-August, Bitcoin had powered through $4,000 and then much higher. Retail traders were suddenly aware of the cryptocurrency and were driving volumes and prices higher.\n\nIn September, Bitcoin consolidated around $4,000 before moving decisively higher to $5,000 and then $6,000 in mid-October. The price of $7,000 was breached on Nov. 2, and then Bitcoin spent the rest of the year melting up: A couple of weeks later Bitcoin passed $8,000, then $10,000, surging to $13,000 days later, eclipsing $16,000 and by mid-December topping out above $19,000.\n\nIn December, Bitcoin futures began trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, helping drive further interest and dollars to the cryptocurrency.\n\nIt was a perilously quick rise for Bitcoin that became self-sustaining. As the news spread, more people rushed in to buy, sending the price seemingly ever higher. But Bitcoin finished the year off its highest levels, ending the breakthrough year of 2017 at $13,850.\n\nJanuary 2018 \u2013 December 2020: Bitcoin recovers and soars even higher\n\nAfter the huge melt-up of 2017, Bitcoin spent most of 2018 in a downtrend, falling throughout the year, following a brief surge to start the year. By the end of the first quarter, Bitcoin was down nearly 50 percent from where it had started the year. It spent much of the year bouncing between $6,000 and $8,000 before closing 2018 at $3,709 \u2013 down 73 percent for the year.\n\nThe year 2019 kicked off with more of the same, as Bitcoin looked for direction. It tried to burst through $4,000 for the first few months, but finally hit it in April and then rose to $5,000. May came and Bitcoin reached $6,000, then $7,000, then $8,000 before settling back in early June. That month Bitcoin swiftly spiked to $13,000 before coming back.\n\nBy September, Bitcoin was back solidly under $10,000, and it continued to search for direction and fell until the end of the year, finishing out 2019 at just under $7,200.\n\nBut with the turn of the calendar to 2020, Bitcoin picked up, rising over the next six weeks to above $10,000. In the midst of the stock market downturns during the initial COVID pandemic wave, Bitcoin wavered, falling to $8,000. Then during the drawdown, it plummeted on March 12, 2020 \u2013 from $7,935 to $4,826 in a single day, a decline of more than 39 percent!\n\nBy early April, it was back above $7,000, then $8,000 and finally began pushing $10,000 in May. After dawdling for a couple of months, it finally rose to more than $11,000 in July and $12,000 in August. It settled over the next few months, until October, when it pushed through $13,000 again and ultimately vaulted to nearly $20,000 in November 2020, as financial markets tore higher on liquidity from the Federal Reserve and the prospect of a COVID vaccine.\n\nBitcoin raced higher during December 2020 and closed out the year at $28,949.\n\nJanuary 2021 \u2013 December 2023: Bitcoin gets pressured\n\nAfter what can only be described as a thrilling end of 2020 for Bitcoin, the digital currency started 2021 with a bang. The cryptocurrency climbed to start the year, peaking above $64,000 by mid-April, following a strong first quarter. Promises of seemingly never-ending liquidity from the Federal Reserve gave markets \u2013 both crypto and stocks \u2013 unbridled optimism.\n\nAfter this auspicious start to the year, there seemed to be only one place to go: down. In May, China warned cryptocurrency buyers that it was going to put pressure on the industry, and the price of Bitcoin began to drop. The country also announced that it was prohibiting financial institutions and payment platforms from transacting in cryptocurrency.\n\nThis news helped throw Bitcoin into a tailspin, where it quickly lost more than 50 percent of its value within a few months.\n\nLater, in September, China announced that all cryptocurrency transactions were illegal and that even foreign websites offering such services to Chinese traders were prohibited. The market shrugged off that news, and by October the currency was back over $60,000 and on its way to a new all-time high, at $68,789, on Nov. 10, 2021.\n\nLate in 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin to taper its bond purchases, slowly draining liquidity from financial markets. With inflation roaring at multi-decade highs, the central bank wanted to tamp down rising prices. The 10-year Treasury rate began to rise, as investors began pricing in the prospect that the Fed would raise interest rates in the near future.\n\nThe prospect of less liquidity in the market threw risky assets such as high-growth stocks for a loop, and cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin followed along, starting in early November.\n\nThat malaise continued into 2022, as rising inflation and a central bank intent on raising rates to thwart it, drove investors from risky assets. Bitcoin bounced around the $40,000 mark for months, but as the Fed started to aggressively raise interest rates in March, it began to sink. In mid-2022, Bitcoin established a new trading range of around $20,000 but then sank to less than $16,000 as high-profile blow-ups such as FTX hurt traders\u2019 confidence.\n\nThe price picked up in 2023, gaining more than 50 percent through mid-June, amid a broader rally in tech stocks. Bitcoin traded for around $26,000 as of mid-June 2023 despite a crackdown by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the crypto industry. It bounced around but was still near $27,000 by late September, before it began to break higher to end the year.\n\nAs interest rates seemed to be peaking in October 2023, Bitcoin started rising again. It ran to more than $42,000 to close out the year, amid rumors that the SEC would finally allow the creation of Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nJanuary 2024: Bitcoin ETFs debut\n\nAfter some months of speculation, the SEC officially permitted Bitcoin to be traded in an ETF, and 11 fund managers were allowed to list funds. Bitcoin ETFs then began trading on January 11, 2024. Bitcoin peaked at nearly $49,000 in the days leading up to the announcement, but cooled somewhat in the weeks following.\n\nBitcoin returns by year\n\nYear Return 2009 N/A 2010 30,203%* 2011 1,467% 2012 187% 2013 5,870% 2014 -61% 2015 35% 2016 124% 2017 1,338% 2018 -73% 2019 94% 2020 302% 2021 60% 2022 -64% 2023 156%\n\nEditorial Disclaimer: All investors are advised to conduct their own independent research into investment strategies before making an investment decision.
