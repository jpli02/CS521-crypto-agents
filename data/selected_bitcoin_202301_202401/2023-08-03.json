        "content": "Bitcoin-loving payments firm Block Inc. today reported gross profit of $1.87 billion in its second quarter 2023 results\u2014a 27% year-over-year increase. And $2.4 billion of its total $5.5 billion Q2 net revenue came from Bitcoin, the company said.\n\nThe company\u2014formerly known as Square\u2014saw a 34% increase in Bitcoin revenue compared to the same period in 2022. Bitcoin revenue refers to the total sale amount of cryptocurrency sold to customers.\n\n\"We delivered strong growth and profitability at scale during the second quarter of 2023,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nBlock's Cash App business Bitcoin revenue stood at $1.16 billion, a 39% increase compared to the same period in 2022. If not for a dip in prices, the company said, the revenue could have contributed even more to its bottom line.\n\n\"The year-over-year increase in Bitcoin revenue and gross profit was driven by an increase in the quantity of Bitcoin sold to customers, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of Bitcoin compared to the prior-year period,\" the company said in a letter to shareholders.\n\nThe company also recorded no impairment losses on its Bitcoin holdings, which now total $245 million, in the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2023.\n\nBlock\u2019s Cash App Bitcoin Revenue Drops 25% Year-Over-Year\n\nAn impairment charge refers to a loss of value in assets\u2014in this case, the digital assets held by the company.\n\nBlock is a payments company founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey. Its popular mobile app, Cash App, is a popular tool for buying and selling Bitcoin.\n\nThe app last year installed the Bitcoin \"second-layer solution\" the Lightning Network\u2014allowing users to make small and quick payments with crypto.\n\nWhat is Bitcoin?\n\nThe move shows just how committed the company is to pushing Bitcoin adoption. In June, Dorsey-backed Bitkey launched the beta for its Bitcoin wallet, which will allow users withdraw BTC from their Coinbase and Cash App wallets using \"copy and paste.\""

        "content": "Ilya Lichtenstein, who last month agreed to forfeit billions in a plea deal for his role in laundering funds from a 2016 hack of crypto exchange Bitfinex, has now admitted he was the hacker.\n\nAlthough it has long been suspected either Lichtenstein or his wife, Heather Morgan, were the ones who stole 120,900 Bitcoin, it's only now been confirmed. The new detail was originally reported by CNBC on Thursday.\n\nThe couple appeared at a sentencing hearing today in Washington D.C.\n\nBitfinex Hackers Agree to Forfeit Billions in Bitcoin in Plea Deal\n\nDuring the court hearing, the Bitfinex hacker also admitted that he and his wife converted some of the stolen crypto assets to gold coins and buried them. According to CNBC\u2019s account of the hearing, Lichtenstein flew to Ukraine and Kazakhstan to convert the crypto to cash before depositing the funds in an American bank account.\n\nLichtenstein and Morgan (also known by her rapper name \"Razzlekhan\") were arrested early last year on charges of having laundered the funds stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. They could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAs part of their plea deal, the couple has agreed to forfeit proceeds from the almost 120,000 Bitcoin they stand accused of laundering. At the time of their arrest, the Department of Justice seized $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin it believed to be connected to the 2016 hack.\n\nAt the time, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said in a press release it was the department\u2019s largest ever seizure of crypto assets and proved \u201ccryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals.\u201d\n\nBitfinex Recovers $314K of the $3.6 Billion Stolen in 2016 Bitcoin Hack\n\nBefore the arrest, investors were keen to track the funds using blockchain data\u2014a maddening bit of transparency for victims who can see their funds being moved around. A few weeks before the plea deal was announced in July, Bitfinex recovered a small portion of the Bitcoin Cash, about $314 thousand, that was taken during the 2016 hack. But the majority of the funds still have not been returned to users.\n\nEditor's Note: This story was updated at 4 p.m. ET on Thursday, August 3 to add additional details about the hearing and context about the hack."

Investors piled $1.3bn into the ETF during the year ended June 30, according to Morningstar.\n\nThis article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group.\n\nFees for the planned ETF were not disclosed.\n\nGlobal X declined to comment.\n\nGlobal X manages $41.8bn in assets across 107 ETFs, according to Morningstar.\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a tactical allocation ETF that adjusts the portfolio from bitcoin futures to T-bills whenever the bitcoin trend weakens,\u201d said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies for North America at Morningstar.\n\n\u201cMarket timing is extremely challenging, so these types of quantitative approaches tend not to be high performers\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first tactical strategy I\u2019ve seen for bitcoin.\u201d\n\nThe first US bitcoin futures ETF, the $1.1 billion ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, launched in October 2021 and was quickly followed by similar offerings from VanEck and Valkyrie, Morningstar data shows.\n\nAlthough bitcoin futures ETFs do not hold the digital asset directly, several issuers have filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. The Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly shot down those applications because of concerns about potential manipulation and a lack of surveillance from the exchanges on which the ETFs would be listed.\n\nLast month, BlackRock set off the latest flurry of new applications or reapplications when it filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF.\n\nBlackRock\u2019s application was quickly followed by similar applications from VanEck, Valkyrie, Fidelity, Invesco, WisdomTree and Bitwise. Ark Invest filed to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in April.\n\nThose spot filings should not be an impediment to the Global X ETF, Armour said.\n\n\u201cThis strategy has a risk-off mechanism that can cause performance to differ significantly from bitcoin itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could also be a long runway to a spot bitcoin ETF, leaving plenty of time for Global X and others to go after that market.\u201d\n\nIgnites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

        "title": "Bitcoin launderer pleads guilty, admits to massive Bitfinex hack - CNBC",
        "content": "watch now\n\nA New York man on Thursday admitted to being the original hacker of bitcoin in the 2016 cyberattack on Bitfinex, a theft that ended up being worth $4.5 billion. Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein, 35, made that bombshell admission while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court. The plea came before his wife, 33-year-old Heather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea to two charges, money laundering conspiracy and conspiracy to defraud the United States government. Until Thursday's admission in court by Lichtenstein, it was not publicly known who had hacked the bitcoin from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. The couple was not charged in the hack itself.\n\nBooking photos for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein. Courtesy: Alexandria Adult Detention Center.\n\nLichtenstein faces a maximum possible sentence of 20 years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The Russian emigre, has been held without bond since his arrest after a judge ruled he is a flight risk, will remain jailed until his sentencing, and has agreed to cooperate with federal investigators. Morgan, an aspiring rapper known as \"Razzlekhan\" and \"The Crocodile of Wall Street,\" faces a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison. She was in the courtroom for her husband's plea hearing. Morgan has been free on $3 million bond since her arrest. Lichtenstein smiled at her and blew her a kiss during their moment of eye contact, the first time they had seen each other in more than a year.\n\nCourtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court. Artist: William Hennessey\n\nWhen they were arrested in February 2022, the Department of Justice said officials had seized more than 94,000 bitcoin of the more than 119,000 hacked bitcoin. The seized cryptocurrency at the time was worth about $3.6 billion, making it the largest seizure in DOJ history. \"Since their arrests, the government has seized another approximately $475 million tied to the hack,\" the DOJ said in a press statement Thursday. Bitfinex in a statement said, \"Following the August 2016 hack, Bitfinex engaged in unprecedented efforts to make its customers whole.\" \"Bitfinex also diligently worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to identify the perpetrators of the hack, recover the stolen bitcoin, and bring the hackers to justice,\" the company said. \"After seven years, those efforts have come to fruition.\" When the bitcoin was stolen, it was worth just $70 million. But its value soared over the years to $4.5 billion. In its statement Thursday, the DOJ said, \"Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex's network.\" \"Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein's control,\" the DOJ said.\n\nHeather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea hearing in the case. Artist: William Hennessey\n\n\"Lichtenstein then took steps to cover his tracks by going back into Bitfinex's network and deleting access credentials and other log files that may have given him away to law enforcement\" the DOJ said. \"Following the hack, Lichtenstein enlisted the help of his wife, Morgan, in laundering the stolen funds.\" When the couple was arrested in early 2022, the department said about \"25,000 of those stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein's wallet via a complicated money laundering process that ended with some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan.\"\n\nHeather Rhiannon Morgan, who was in the audience, stepped up to enter her own guilty plea hearing in the case. Artist: William Hennessey\n\nDuring Lichtenstein's plea hearing, it was revealed that he had converted some assets to gold coins, and that Morgan had buried gold coins at a location now known to law enforcement officials. And it also was revealed that Lichtenstein's past travel to Ukraine and Kazakhstan was done to convert digital assets to cash through Russian and Ukrainian middlemen. That cash was then shipped to addresses in Russia and Ukraine, where Lichtenstein picked it up physically and deposited it into U.S. accounts so he could retrieve it while in New York City. The Crypto Couple's separate plea hearings were moved up from their originally scheduled times Thursday due to arraignment later in the afternoon at the same courthouse of Donald Trump. The former president was charged Thursday in that case with crimes related to an effort to overturn his 2020 election loss. A charging document filed last month against the couple says that in early 2107 Lichtenstein \"began to move a portion of the bitcoin\" stolen in the hack \"in a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms.\"\n\nCourtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in Washington, D.C., federal court.
