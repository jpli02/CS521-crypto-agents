        "content": "As speculation about the upcoming approval or denial of spot-Bitcoin ETFs reaches a fever pitch, a group of former Citigroup Inc. executives is starting to offer securities backed by the oldest cryptocurrency that they say don\u2019t need the blessing of US regulators.\n\nThe new offering, called Bitcoin depositary receipts, will be similar to American depositary receipts that represent foreign stocks. The startup, called Receipts Depositary Corporation, or RDC, said it plans to issue the first Bitcoin depositary receipts to qualified global institutional investors in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933."

The main reason, I wrote, is that crypto used to be a laboratory for rediscovering central intuitions about finance: Crypto was building a brand-new alternative financial system from scratch, and crypto enthusiasts were discovering solutions to financial problems for themselves. Sometimes those solutions were better than the traditional solutions, and sometimes they were worse, and sometimes they just used new terminology to re-describe solutions that traditional finance discovered years ago, but in any case they were fun to write about. Better, or worse, or the same, they provided a lens through which to see traditional finance; seeing why crypto did something, and why it did or didn\u2019t work, could help you understand why traditional finance does things the way it does."

        "content": "In this issue of the Bloomberg Crypto newsletter, Michael P. Regan wonders what the SEC thinks about the huge role that Coinbase is poised to play in proposed spot-Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWhen it comes to discussions about the US finally approving a spot-Bitcoin ETF or issuing more rejections, there\u2019s a gorilla in the room that few seem to be acknowledging: Coinbase Global Inc.\n\n\n\nThe largest US crypto exchange \u2013 and the only one that\u2019s a public company \u2013 is poised to play a major role as a middleman between the crypto market and the traditional equities market where the exchange-traded funds would trade.\n\n\n\nThe only twist? The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase in June, alleging that the company acted as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearinghouse without registering with the agency for any of those roles.\n\n\n\nAt the time, the company\u2019s chief legal officer said it would fight the SEC in court while simultaneously pushing for a legislative solution on crypto regulations that the company hoped would advance in the House of Representatives by the end of the summer. That didn\u2019t happen, of course, and anyone who\u2019s been paying attention to US politics knows Congress can barely agree on a lunch order \u2013 or even to keep the government open, for that matter -- let alone pass major legislation like that. There was even talk at the time that the legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC could end up in the Supreme Court, yet the case hasn\u2019t even gone to trial yet. And the US high court sort of has its hands full at the moment anyway with, you know, the whole future of American democracy and whatnot."

        "content": "The crypto world is betting its mainstream moment is here. That bet hinges on the blessing of Wall Street\u2019s top cop.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is expected in the coming days to rule on whether 14 different money managers will be allowed to launch their own spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n\nThese ETFs would allow everyday investors to get exposure to bitcoin (BTC-USD) without having to own it, trading it like they would a stock.\n\nThe approvals could also expand widespread acceptance of the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency, making bitcoin a potential staple in 401(k)s, IRAs, and pension plans used by everyday people.\n\nThe applicants include some of the biggest names on Wall Street, from BlackRock (BLK) to Franklin Templeton (BEN), as well as a number of firms better known in the crypto world.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) are among the giant banks that have offered to help some of these money managers create and redeem shares of their new funds.\n\nBlackRock, the world's largest money manager, is among the applicants seeking approval from the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. (Fatih Aktas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nThe challenge before the industry is that the SEC has in the past denied such applications, arguing the products were vulnerable to market manipulation. The regulator is also the industry's most prominent adversary, having filed numerous lawsuits and enforcement actions against key players.\n\nThose in the crypto world say there are signs that the SEC won\u2019t stand in the way this time around and will give the green light to all 14 applicants at once.\n\nSuch optimism helped bitcoin surge more than 150% in 2023 and start 2024 by rising above $45,000, its highest level in nearly two years.\n\nIt is also helping investors move past the memories of 2022, when some of the industry\u2019s biggest names were wiped out as the values of digital assets collapsed.\n\n\"The bitcoin ETFs will be the official nail in the coffin on that prior crypto winter,\" Laurence Latimer, CEO and co-founder of crypto firm Dinara, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nA number of applicants \u2014 including Bitwise, Hashdex, and VanEck \u2014 have already released teaser video ads ahead of what they expect to be their potential launch.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Bitcoin\u2019s time has arrived,\" reads the tagline of the Hashdex spot.\n\nBut in a sign of how much is riding on these approvals, bitcoin tumbled nearly 10% earlier this week after one industry analyst floated a contrarian view of what the SEC may do.\n\nMarkus Thielen, head of research at crypto investment firm Matrixport, said in a note Tuesday that the SEC will reject all ETF applications this month and the products won\u2019t get the green light until at least the second quarter. If that happens, bitcoin prices could fall by 20%, according to the note.\n\n\"While we have seen frequent meetings between the ETF applicants and staff from the SEC, which resulted in the applicants refiling their applications,\" the note added, \"we believe all applications fall short of a critical requirement that must be met before the SEC approves.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler has consistently voiced skepticism about the crypto industry. (Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe note cited general skepticism from SEC chair Gary Gensler, who has led the agency\u2019s larger crackdown on the crypto world.\n\nIt also came as bitcoin trading volume spiked to highs not seen since the collapse of regional lender Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.\n\nA decade in the making\n\nThe crypto industry has been waiting more than a decade for this moment.\n\nThe first application to create a spot bitcoin ETF came in 2013 from crypto entrepreneurs and twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, famous for their early role in the creation of Facebook. Since then, the SEC has denied more than 30 similar applications.\n\nEntrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who filed for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in 2013. (Lucas Jackson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nA key turnaround moment came last year in June when the world\u2019s biggest money manager, BlackRock, filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The interest from one of Wall Street\u2019s biggest names sparked other asset managers to follow suit.\n\nAnother important development came last August when one of the ETF applicants, Grayscale Investments, won a key legal victory over the SEC. Grayscale had sued the SEC in 2022 after it wasn't allowed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot bitcoin offering.\n\nIts core argument was that the agency had already approved exchange-traded products that held bitcoin futures contracts and thus had \"acted arbitrarily and capriciously.\"\n\n\u200bA three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in Washington sided with Grayscale, saying the firm had \"advanced substantial evidence\" its product was similar to bitcoin futures ETFs previously approved by the SEC.\n\nThat forced the SEC to reconsider Grayscale\u2019s spot bitcoin ETF application, along with others filed by rival money managers.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s first deadline to consider these various ETFs is Jan. 10 for a joint offering from Ark Invest and 21Shares. Other deadlines are as late as April.\n\nLet the race begin\n\nETF issuers and analysts say they believe the SEC will choose to approve all applications that pass muster by the earliest January deadline, so as not to give any first movers an advantage over the rest of the industry.\n\nOne of the applicants, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood, told Yahoo Finance that the dominant providers of spot bitcoin ETFs will be those that take in the most money from investors right out of the gate.\n\nThe winners \"will be a few and it will be the most liquid,\" she said.\n\nCathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, is among the applicants seeking approval from the SEC to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. (Patrick T. FALLON / AFP) (PATRICK T. FALLON via Getty Images)\n\nHistorically, launches for other bitcoin products have sent bitcoin\u2019s price on a wild ride.\n\nIt happened in 2017 with the launch of the country\u2019s first bitcoin futures contracts and then in 2021 with the SEC\u2019s approval of the country's first bitcoin futures ETFs. Prices soared and then fell by large amounts in the year following the launches.\n\nThis time around, \"there's good pent-up demand so you'll see good flows,\u201d Sandy Kaul, Franklin Templeton's head of digital assets, told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"But I think that the transformative flows are really going to come in about six months to a year when people start to see what these ETFs actually offer in terms of the portfolio performance.\"\n\nWhat is clear, she added, is that the approval of these products would offer \"a real affirmation of the crypto ecosystem being a legitimate investment opportunity.\"\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nThe price of bitcoin rose more than 150% in 2023. A prior version of this article incorrectly reported the rise was 164% through January 1.\n\nClick here for the latest crypto news, updates, values, prices, and more related to bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin, DeFi, and NFTs\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
