        "title": "Could Bitcoin Help You Become a Millionaire? - The Motley Fool",
        "content": "Since July 2010 (the earliest data available from coinmarketcap.com), Bitcoin has produced a ridiculous return of nearly 43,000,000%. That crushes the gains of both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index by insanely wide margins. And it has no doubt made some early adopters extremely wealthy.\n\nEven though Bitcoin has been around for about 14 years, I don't think it's too late to get in on the action. Right now, the price is 61% off its all-time high from November 2021, so there is some heightened pessimism around this top cryptocurrency. But can buying now help you become a millionaire?\n\nGiven enough time, I believe the answer is a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nThere is a clear need for Bitcoin\n\nIt's important to first take a step back and understand why Bitcoin is even needed in the world. Think about citizens dealing with corrupt governments (like Mexico's), or currencies that experience hyperinflation (like in Venezuela), or countries ravaged by war (like Afghanistan). The people in these places can't rely on the current financial systems that are in place. A decentralized form of money that can't be confiscated, that isn't controlled by anyone, and that can be stored on the internet or devices that connect to the web is extremely valuable in these types of situations.\n\nIn the U.S., skeptics would make the argument that there is no need for Bitcoin because we have a robust payments industry and developed capital markets. This misses the point that Bitcoin is a global network. Moreover, we take our working financial infrastructure for granted, while people in other countries struggle with a lack of basic banking services or stable currency.\n\nPlus, Bitcoin does serve a need in the U.S. Some investors and institutions are keen on holding a portion of their wealth in the world's most valuable cryptocurrency. That's because Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million, yet over the past decade, central banks around the world have pumped so much money into the economy to stimulate growth after the Great Recession and throughout the coronavirus pandemic. The more fiat money, or government-backed currency, that there is relative to Bitcoin, the better the prospects for the latter's price appreciation.\n\nThe staggering debt burden of the U.S., which will only be exacerbated by further increases of the national debt ceiling in the future, also tells me that we can't keep interest rates high for too long. This increases the odds of elevated levels of inflation for extended periods of time. Holding Bitcoin makes even more sense with this in mind.\n\nRunning the numbers\n\nBitcoin has a market cap of about $516 billion. But let's say that a decade from now, its entire value equals that of the total value of all the world's gold, or roughly $12.5 trillion. I don't think this scenario is out of the question. As more individuals, corporations, and governments learn about Bitcoin and its attractive properties, it's probable that they would at least store a small fraction of their investable assets or reserves in it.\n\nThis would mean that Bitcoin's price would rise about 25-fold between now and the summer of 2033. This performance would likely crush what investors could earn putting their money in the stock market (or any asset class, for that matter). This projection suggests that a $40,000 investment in Bitcoin today could make someone a millionaire in 10 years' time.\n\nTo be clear, there are a ton of risks to think about. The most pressing one is the threat of governments banning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making it illegal to buy and own these digital assets. That's something to always keep in mind. Additionally, Bitcoin simply might not be adopted as widely as many hope.\n\nBitcoin could reach that projected value in a much longer time frame, or maybe not at all. The range of outcomes is vast.\n\nNonetheless, the potential is certainly there for Bitcoin to make you a millionaire."

        "title": "Ohio needs to champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies| columnist - The Columbus Dispatch",
        "content": "Andrew Burchwell\n\nGuest Columnist\n\nOhio\u2019s historical legacy is rooted in innovation. Our economic success and progress have always depended on our willingness to try new things \u2013 leading to innovations in energy manufacturing, healthcare, IT and more. Today, as we see new opportunities through digital advancements in blockchain technologies like bitcoin, it\u2019s critical we keep our innovative spirit alive and open to stay competitive in an increasingly complex and global environment.\n\nOhioans might be surprised to learn that our state is home to many industry leaders in bitcoin and blockchain development. One reason for the unfamiliarity is that industry leaders benefit from a unified voice to advocate for the industry\u2019s potential, and Ohio is just beginning to organize and champion bitcoin and blockchain technologies from a statewide perspective.\u200b\n\nIf we do not act with an intention, Ohio will miss out on a generational opportunity for its communities, businesses, and families. We are still very early in the development of these technologies, and it is an opportunity Ohio is uniquely positioned to capture.\n\nAt Ohio Blockchain Council, we are working to unite industries under a common banner to advance bitcoin and blockchain technologies for and within our great state. We believe Ohio is well positioned to be a global leader in innovation and development. Combining the resources of multiple companies from various business sectors is our most effective pathway to progress.\n\nOne of the barriers to adoption of any technology is public understanding. The technology behind Bitcoin and blockchain is unquestionably complicated. What is not complicated, though still underemphasized in our public conversation, is the direct positive impact these technologies could have on all of Ohio\u2019s communities. Families across Ohio struggle with high healthcare costs. Recently the Cleveland Clinic, IBM, Aetna and Anthem announced a partnership that will utilize blockchain to improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance customer experience.\n\nOhio\u2019s rural population stands to uniquely benefit from bitcoin adoption. While bitcoin mining operations like the Standard Power facility in Coshocton create jobs and increase local economic activity, the long-term implications of bitcoin adoption are far greater. It looks like farmers utilizing bitcoin to exert greater control over their pricing, markets and quality assurance. It means small businesses using bitcoin to avoid fees and open themselves up to new customer bases. It allows a new source of funding for municipalities struggling to compete and provide new accommodations for residents. These are just a few examples of the many ways in which the lives of Ohioans will be transformed for the better through innovation.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technology also carry the potential to help solve one of our most complicated and pervasive challenges today: public trust. According to a recent Pew Research report, only two out of 10 Americans trust the federal government. University of Chicago Institute of Politics research indicates that a majority of Americans agree with the statement \u201cthe government is corrupt and rigged against everyday people like me.\u201d Here in Ohio, where we\u2019re living through a still unfolding massive public corruption scandal, it\u2019s very likely trust in public institutions is at an all-time low.\n\nBlockchain technology can help rebuild public trust by enhancing accountability in government contracting, electronic voting, grant disbursement and more, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. That\u2019s because blockchain technology is by definition decentralized, objective and transparent.\n\nMore:Logistics, bitcoin companies receive state tax incentives to create 125 jobs in Columbus\n\nOhio\u2019s congressional delegation has been championing these issues because they know how important they are to our state\u2019s growth. It\u2019s not a red vs. blue issue, and has been overwhelmingly bipartisan through the leadership of Rep. Warren Davidson (R) and Rep. Joyce Beatty (D) in the House of Representatives and newly elected Sen. J.D. Vance (R) in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) has been absent as a champion and leader on bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology. He sits as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction on these important issues, but has yet to be a forward-leaning advocate for our state. Senator Brown has the opportunity to propel Ohio into a category of its own on bitcoin, and we are here to show him that the work being done across our beautiful state is only just beginning.\n\nBitcoin and blockchain technologies represent significant potential for uplifting communities, businesses, and families. Harnessing this potential is only possible through an aligned, unified and collaborative approach toward adoption and public policy. This is our mission at Ohio Blockchain Council, and we believe Ohio can truly become the heart of it all.\n\nAndrew Burchwell, executive director of Ohio Blockchain Council"

        "content": "JPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin could track gold higher, reaching up to $45,000.\n\nPro traders, as well as commodities analysts, say Bitcoin is too speculative to be considered gold-like.\n\nThe narratives underlie the surging cryptocurrency, which has gained about 50% this year.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s digital gold comparisons are mounting with the top cryptocurrency trading back around levels last seen in July of last year.\n\nJPMorgan analysts say Bitcoin could track gold higher over the next year. Even as sophisticated investors retreat from the top cryptocurrency, analysts say Bitcoin and gold were viewed as hedges to a \u201ccatastrophic scenario.\u201d\n\nNOW READ: Even non-crypto people are asking \u2018what\u2019s going on\u2019 with Bitcoin\u2019s surge to $30,000\n\nFor crypto natives, Bitcoin has long been framed as a haven outside the traditional finance sector, especially in times of economic and monetary strife. This year\u2019s banking crisis, along with regulatory crackdowns on crypto exchanges, have helped fuel that idea.\n\nStay ahead of the game with our weekly newsletters Subscribe\n\nClouding this narrative is that for pro traders, Bitcoin is a risk-on asset. Indeed, Bitcoin has tracked the tech-stock heavy Nasdaq higher \u2014 the Nasdaq has jumped about 28% this year, while Bitcoin has rocketed up about 50%.\n\nBitcoin has enjoyed many narratives over its 14-year history, most dividing insiders and outsiders. The asset\u2019s pseudonymous founder envisaged a peer-to-peer version of electronic cash that would allow users to avoid financial institutions.\n\n\u201cBitcoin \u2013 the seminal cryptocurrency \u2013 has been many things over its 14 years of existence: a proof-of-concept, tech plaything, a monetary vehicle for criminals, digital gold, etc.,\u201d Ryan Shea, a crypto economist at Trakx, wrote last month.\n\nThe digital gold narrative for Bitcoin is undergoing a renaissance, Shea added.\n\nJoin the community to get our latest stories and updates\n\nHedges in catastrophic times\n\nBitcoin and gold were viewed as hedges during the US banking crisis in March, JPMorgan said. Institutional investors favoured gold while retail shifted to Bitcoin during the crisis that saw lenders like Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank shutter.\n\nJPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said the banking crisis in the US \u201cexposed the weaknesses of the traditional finance system,\u201d driving crypto natives to Bitcoin. From a macroeconomic perspective, the bailouts of those banks played a role.\n\nNOW READ: Hodling pays off for patient Bitcoin investors with 1,000x returns\n\n\u201cExtra liquidity, that\u2019s the difference,\u201d between the haven narrative and the cryptocurrency\u2019s tendency to mirror more risk-on assets, Markus Thielen, head of crypto research and strategy at Matrixport, told DL News in March. He spoke after news of the US government\u2019s intervention in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\n\u201cIt went risk-on when the Fed provided deposit guarantees and traders realised that liquidity would be pumped into the system,\u201d even as \u201csome parts of the economy are in stress,\u201d including banks, he said. \u201cThis is helping Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nDemand for both\n\nDemand for both may be rising in tandem, with some retail investors buying Bitcoin as a speculative play, while others buy gold for \u201call the usual reasons,\u201d Metals Focus analysts told DL News.\n\n\u201cWe would still not go as far as saying Bitcoin is a \u2018digital\u2019 form of gold even though they may have benefitted from the same drivers recently,\u201d they added, noting that gold, the S&P 500 and Bitcoin have rallied together in the past, and, \u201cnobody says stocks are the new gold.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is too speculative in nature with too many structural unknowns to be considered gold-like, Metals Focus analysts added, noting that the exchange\u2019s collapse can drive the price of Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation with gold turned negative today for the first time since March.\n\nBitcoin's correlation to gold just turned negative (Kaiko)\n\nPro traders and their crypto-native counterparts are also dealing with signs of the dollar\u2019s eroding hegemony.\n\n\u201cAs the de-dollarization narrative starts to take shape, it would be rational to expect both risk assets and gold to perform, which would act as a secular tailwind for Bitcoin,\u201d Jonah Van Bourg, global head of trading at DRW\u2019s Cumberland, told DL News.\n\nNOW READ: Bitcoin becomes haven during bank bloodbath with 28% surge: \u2018Extra liquidity, that\u2019s the difference\u2019\n\nBitcoin will eventually trade on its own fundamentals, Ed Moya, senior markets analyst at Oanda told DL News. \u201cIt might not necessarily end up being digital gold,\u201d he added. \u201cWe could see a strong divergence\u201d next year.\n\nInstitutions ditch Bitcoin\n\nBitcoin might be a gold-like play in the eyes of retail investors, but sophisticated traders have been decreasing their holdings over the past two years.\n\nJPMorgan took wallets holding less than 10 BTC as a proxy for retail investors, and those with more than 10 BTC as a proxy for institutional investors \u2013\u2013 which includes family offices and wealthy individuals, asset managers, crypto exchanges, Bitcoin miners, funds, ETFs, and early Bitcoin investors.\n\nRetail traders have increased holdings this year, while institutional holdings have steadily declined.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the institutional impulse has been declining since 2022,\u201d JPMorgan said last week.\n\nOn-chain Bitcoin flows, retail vs. institutions (JPMorgan)\n\n\u201cRetail investors\u2019 demand for bitcoin is likely to strengthen as we approach the April 2024 halving event,\u201d JPMorgan said. The bank expects Bitcoin to trade in a range of $40,000 to $45,000 leading up to this.\n\nMoya said that Bitcoin will likely trade between $30,000 and $40,000, \u201cif the regulatory environment doesn\u2019t kill crypto,\u201d in the meantime."
