        "content": "First, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. highlighted Bitcoin as the best-performing asset in terms of absolute and risk-adjusted returns earlier this year. Then the banking crisis happened and the largest digital coin rose to its highest price in ten months. It's enough to make even some naysayers reconsider.\n\nBut is this year\u2019s turnaround just a short-lived bubble or evidence of the what-doesn't-kill-you-makes-you-stronger thesis? Views are all over the place. The White House put out an economic report recently slamming crypto, saying the assets don't have fundamental value; while Bitcoin bulls like ARK Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood see its climb as an affirmation of decentralization."

        "title": "'Bitcoin Stamps' NFTs Are Gaining On Ordinals - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "There\u2019s another wave of NFTs starting to flood the Bitcoin blockchain\u2014and they\u2019re not in the form of Ordinals.\n\nThe emergent STAMPS (Secure Tradeable Art Maintained Securely) protocol is proposing a different method of embedding image data into the OG blockchain, making different tradeoffs compared to the inscription technology that exploded in popularity earlier this year.\n\nRather than storing image data within prunable transaction witness data, \u201cBitcoin Stamps\u201d store it directly within spendable transaction outputs.\n\n\u201cBy doing so, the data is preserved in such a manner that is impossible to prune from a full node, preserving the data immutably forever,\u201d wrote pseudonymous Stamps creator Mike In Space on the project\u2019s GitHub page. The developer noted that he is already in discussions with Emblem and Hiro Wallet to arrange protocol integrations, the former of which will allow users to buy and sell Stamps on OpenSea.\n\nMagic Eden\u2019s New Bitcoin NFT Marketplace Dominates Ordinals Market\n\nAs Ordinals growth surged in early February, proponents argued that they were superior to NFTs on other platforms because they store image data within the Bitcoin blockchain. By contrast, Ethereum NFTs are usually just image pointers to centralized hosting services, which can be changed by anyone with control of the image URL.\n\nYet even Ordinals data can be pruned by choice by individual node runners, limiting the immutability and decentralization benefits of such NFTs. As such, Bitcoin Stamps go all the way, forcing nodes to store their image data across many different unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\n\nThe NFT is then broadcast across the network using Counterparty\u2014an old protocol that ushered in Bitcoin images back in 2014 before the term \u201cNFT\u201d even existed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are good for the preservation of art forever by storing them securely on the strongest ledger ever devised by man backed by Proof of Work,\u201d the creator told Decrypt via DM. He added that other services are already being built atop the STAMPS protocol, such as a Name Service by Rarity Garden.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith 11,000 NFTs Minted to Bitcoin, Are Bitcoin Maxis Coming Around?\n\nBut storing data across all Bitcoin nodes comes at a cost\u2014quite literally. In fact, the protocol creator suggests using Stamps for lightweight \u201c24x24 pixel, 8-color-depth PNG or GIF\u201d files to make up for their implicit storage costs.\n\n\u201cThe constraints of this \"canvas\" are ideal for pixel art,\u201d he wrote on GitHub. \u201cIn particular, the CryptoPunks use a native resolution of 24x24 pixels.\u201d\n\nStamps also come with the benefit of being \u201csemi-fungible\u201d: they can be issued as \u201c1 of 1\u201d or \u201c1 of many\u201d digital assets. Trevor.btc on Twitter, host of The Ordinals Show, recognized this feature as similar to the Ethereum ERC-1155 multi-token standard, and as a reason for their remarkably fast growth.\n\nThe Stamps website shows that over 8,300 Stamps have been minted since their launch on March 7, compared to under 500 Ordinals within the same time period after their launch.\n\nThat said, the number of Ordinals on Bitcoin only continues to grow, now standing at over 910,000 inscriptions to date, according to Dune Analytics. Major brands including Bored Ape Yacht Club and Bugatti have already adopted the tech."

My activity at the Company has naturally diminished into a less active role than in the 2018-2021 period, particularly since Marcus Dent, AJ Scalia, and Drew Armstrong joined the Board and AJ and Drew took the reins as management in Q3 2021.\n\nThough I will no longer serve on the Board, I will continue to be an advocate for the Company. I remain the largest individual shareholder and Cathedra is the most promising investment I have in the space. If I had any doubts about the Company\u2019s prospects, I would not have made this decision. Indeed, it is my confidence in the existing Board along with the management team which gives me peace of mind as a long-term shareholder.\n\nI have enjoyed my time on the Board and would like to thank my fellow directors for their diligent work over the past few years.\"\n\nStatement from Drew Armstrong:\n\n\"We thank Roy for his service during his five-year tenure at Cathedra. Roy\u2019s vision and prudence have directly benefited shareholders, employees, and partners alike. We look forward to Roy\u2019s continued support as a shareholder. The Board has begun working to fill the vacant independent director seat with a worthy replacement and will update the market in due time.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAbout Cathedra Bitcoin\n\nCathedra Bitcoin Inc.
