        "content": "Your Web3 Gaming Power-Up Enjoy exclusive benefits with the GG Membership Pass\n\nDecrypt\u2019s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is moving to seize millions of dollars in Bitcoin that a teenage hacker had stolen from crypto executives four years ago. Prosecutors are also making sure they recover the sports car he bought with the stolen Bitcoin back, too.\n\nLast week, a federal judge signed off on an order demanding that Ahmad Wagaafe Hared turn over $5.2 million in Bitcoin that he stole back in 2016, according to a report in The San Francisco Standard. The Bitcoin and the car were stolen as part of a SIM-swapping scheme hatched by Hared and two co-conspirators between 2016 and 2018.\n\nSIM-swapping is when a hacker deceives a cell phone carrier into handing over control of a target\u2019s cell phone by pretending to be the phone\u2019s owner. The tactic is a classic social engineering tactic used by hackers to get access to personal data to steal from their targets\u2014or to bypass text-message based second-factor authentication measures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn 2016, Harred\u2014then 18 and living in Tucson, Arizona\u2014worked in concert with named co-conspirator Matthew Gene Ditman of Nevada to trick customer support representatives of cell phone providers into disclosing details about the SIM cards assigned to the accounts of cryptocurrency executives in northern California.\n\nThough the executives are not unnamed, the region is home to Silicon Valley and an entire ecosystem of cryptocurrency companies and start-ups alike. Coinbase, the biggest exchange in the United States, once counted San Francisco as its home, but has since moved to being an entirely remote company.\n\nHarred was already a known denizen of the so-called darknet, where he went by the username \u2018winblo,\u2019 according to independent cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs. Using this identity, Harred was said to be \"extremely active\" and \"revered\" on an online marketplace where highly prized social media accounts were sold to buyers.\n\nWith some of these stolen funds, Harred purchased a BMW i8 that Krebs reported had a cost of approximately $150,000 at the time. Prosecutors said in their indictment that the two called some of their victims after seizing control of their accounts in a bid to further extort them.\n\nThe scheme came to an end in 2019 after an investigation by the FBI identified Harred and Ditman and arrested the two. The pair have yet to be sentenced.\n\nAD\n\nAD"

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) is recovering from a \u201cblack swan\u201d event last rivaled by the March 2020 COVID-19 crash, data suggests.\n\nIn one of its Quicktake posts on Sept. 7, on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed a major spike in loss-making unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).\n\nCryptoQuant: Bitcoin UTXOs in Loss \u201cmirror\u201d March 2020\n\nBitcoin may be worrying market participants with current BTC price weakness, but on-chain data paints an intriguing picture of activity \u201cunder the hood.\u201d\n\nUTXOs represent BTC left over after an on-chain transaction is executed. CryptoQuant\u2019s UTXOs in Loss metric tracks when large numbers of these UTXOs are worth more than they were when the BTC was originally bought.\n\nCurrently, more of these are in loss compared to their original acquisition price than at any time since March 2020.\n\nAt the time, BTC/USD dropped 60% to its lowest levels since March 2019 \u2014 lows which were never seen again.\n\nConsidering the current data from UTXOs in Loss, CryptoQuant contributor Woominkyu ventured that, like in March 2020, Bitcoin might be seeing, or already bouncing back from, a curveball selling event.\n\nHe summarized:\n\n\u201cGiven that the current level of the \u2018UTXOs in loss\u2019 indicator mirrors that of the Black Swan event between March and April 2020 (due to the Coronavirus), those anticipating another Black Swan event might want to consider whether we are already in the midst of the event they are waiting for.\u201d\n\nBitcoin UTXOs in loss chart. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nIn percentage terms, 38% of UTXOs were in loss at the end of August, a figure last seen in April 2020.\n\n\u201cWhen many UTXOs are in loss, investors might be more inclined to sell, hinting at market anxiety. Conversely, when most UTXOs are profitable, it suggests an optimistic outlook and a stronger holding sentiment among investors,\u201d Woominkyu added.\n\nUnderwater Bitcoin speculators grow\n\nBitcoin meanwhile remains locked in a tight range amid a lack of overall BTC price trend.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin speculators now own the least BTC since $69K all-time highs\n\nWith neither a breakout nor breakdown willing to complete, cost basis data likewise shows current spot price caught between the acquisition prices of various investor cohorts.\n\nThis \u201cRealized Price\u201d \u2014 the price at which the supply last moved, divided by age group \u2014 shows that short-term holders fall into aggregate loss when BTC/USD is below around $27,000.\n\nA full capitulation event, however, has yet to be recorded on-chain.\n\nBitcoin Realized Price chart (screenshot).

        "title": "How Much of All Money Is in Bitcoin? - Investopedia",
        "content": "How Much Is Bitcoin Worth?\n\nOn Sep. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth approximately $25,758. There were more than 19.48 million bitcoins circulating, giving it a total value of over $500 billion. This is much less than in 2021, when its value reached more than $64,000\u2014giving it a total value of about $1.2 trillion at the time.\n\nKey Takeaways One bitcoin was worth $25,758 as of Sep. 10, 2023.\n\nAll the bitcoins in the world were worth over $500 billion.\n\nThe combined value of bitcoin was equivalent to just 0.11% of the world's money.\n\nBitcoin was worth only about 3.4% of the world's gold supply.\n\nAll cryptocurrencies combined accounted for about 0.23% of the world's money.\n\nBitcoin and the Money Supply\n\nTo get a sense of how much of the world's money is in bitcoins, we must determine the total amount of money. As it turns out, this is not the easiest question to answer. Such a calculation might take into account dozens of categories of wealth, including banknotes, precious metals, money market accounts, and debt. Luckily, Credit Suisse has already done the work\u2014the bank calculated total global wealth to be $454.4 trillion at the end of 2022.\n\nThat leaves Bitcoin at about 0.11% of the estimated total value of wealth globally.\n\nMarket capitalization is considered a controversial metric, especially when applied to cryptocurrencies. Although it's a convenient way to assess the total value of an asset, it is highly subject to manipulation.\n\nBitcoin vs. Gold\n\nHow does Bitcoin compare to gold? After all, some people still consider gold to be the safest of safe haven assets. It is certainly the standard to which other currencies must be compared. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that about 244,000 tons of gold had been mined as of Sep. 10, 2023. There are 32,000 ounces of gold in one ton, and the price of gold per ounce was about $1,919.08 as of the market close on Sep. 8, 2023. So, the total value of all gold can be estimated as:\n\n( 244,000 tons of gold x 32,000 ounces per ton ) x $1,919.08 per ounce = $14.98 trillion.\n\nIn total, the value of all Bitcoin was about 3.4% of the value of all above-ground gold reserves.\n\nOther Cryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin is the largest and best-known cryptocurrency in the global economy. However, it is far from the only one. If we combine Bitcoin with Litecoin, Monero, Ethereum, and all other significant cryptocurrencies, the total value comes to roughly $1.04 trillion (as of Sep. 10, 2023). That was about 0.23% of the value of all money.\n\nWarning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, illiquid, and vulnerable to slippage and price manipulation. Before investing, make sure you understand the risks associated with virtual assets.\n\nWhat Percentage of all Money Is Bitcoin? Bitcoin's percentage of all money is much lower than you might expect. On Sep. 10, 2023, the value of all bitcoins was 0.11% of all money.\n\nWhat Is the Total Value of all Bitcoins? The combined value of all bitcoins on Sep. 10, 2023 was about $504 billion.\n\nFor How Much Does Bitcoin Sell? On Sep. 10, 2023, 1 BTC was worth about $25,758.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, one of the thousands of new digital or virtual currencies available globally. It can be used as a store of value, a way to exchange value, or as a speculative investment. Its value changes daily, sometimes tens of dollars or more. It is a volatile asset that changes its market capitalization and percentage of total money almost daily.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.

        "title": "TON, XLM, XMR, and MKR could attract buyers if Bitcoin rises above $26,500 - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) traded in a narrow range this week and is on target to form the third consecutive Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart. The cryptocurrency markets did not receive any support from the United States equities markets, which ended the week on a negative note. The S&P 500 Index dropped 1.3% while the Nasdaq closed down 1.9%.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s weakness has dragged several altcoins lower, with many testing multi-week lows. This indicates that the broader crypto market is in a firm bear grip. Negative markets make it difficult for buyers to identify short-term bullish trades as rallies hardly sustain. However, it could be a good time for long-term investors to build a portfolio.\n\nCrypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360\n\nAccording to a recent Amberdata report, 24% of asset management firms are appointing senior executives dedicated to the implementation of digital strategies. Down the line, 13% more firms plan to adopt a digital assets strategy. This indicates \u201cseriousness about implementation as well as senior management buy-in,\u201d the report added.\n\nCould Bitcoin break out to the upside, boosting buying interest in altcoins? Let\u2019s study the charts of the top five cryptocurrencies that are showing promise in the near term.\n\nBitcoin price analysis\n\nBitcoin has been trading near the $26,000 level for the past few days, indicating a tussle between the bulls and the bears.\n\nBTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe downsloping moving averages indicate advantage to bears but the positive divergence on the relative strength index suggests that the selling pressure is reducing. The indicators are not giving a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nTherefore, it is better to wait for the price to either sustain above $26,500 or dive below $24,800 before placing large bets.\n\nIf bulls overcome the obstacle at $26,500, the BTC/USDT pair could soar to the overhead resistance at $28,143. On the other hand, a fall below $24,800 could clear the path for a collapse to $20,000.\n\nBTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price has been trading near the moving averages on the four-hour chart, indicating a lack of interest from both the bulls and the bears. This tight-range trading is unlikely to continue for long and may lead to a range expansion within the next few days.\n\nOn the upside, a rally above $26,500 will indicate that the advantage has tilted in favor of the buyers. That may start an up-move to $27,600 and eventually to $28,143.\n\nAlternatively, if the price breaks below $25,300, the selling could pick up and the pair may retest the Aug. 17 intraday low of $25,166.\n\nToncoin price analysis\n\nToncoin (TON) has pulled back to the 20-day exponential moving average ($1.69). In an uptrend, a correction to the 20-day EMA usually offers a low-risk entry opportunity.\n\nTON/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA is likely to act as a strong support. If the price snaps back from the 20-day EMA, it will indicate that the sentiment has turned positive and traders are buying on dips. The TON/USDT pair could first rise to $1.89 and thereafter attempt a rally to $2.07.\n\nInstead, if the price continues lower and plummets below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bulls are bailing out of their positions. That could open the doors for a possible drop to $1.53 and next to the 50-day simple moving average ($1.45).\n\nTON/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the bears are trying to sink the price below the immediate support at $1.72, but the bulls have held their ground. The downsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the negative territory increases the risk of a downside breakdown.\n\nIf the $1.72 support cracks, the pair could skid to $1.66 and later nosedive to the strong support at $1.53. Contrarily, if bulls propel the price above the moving averages, it will suggest the start of a stronger recovery to $1.90 and subsequently to $2.\n\nStellar price analysis\n\nStellar (XLM) has staged a smart recovery in the past few days, indicating that the buyers are attempting a comeback.\n\nXLM/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe XLM/USDT pair broke above the 20-day EMA ($0.12) on Sept. 4, and the bulls thwarted attempts by the bears to yank the price back below it on Sept. 5 and 6. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the 20-day EMA into support.\n\nThe price has reached the 50-day SMA ($0.13), which is behaving as a roadblock. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that they have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls are not rushing to the exit. If the price breaks above the 50-day SMA, the pair could soar to $0.15 and later to $0.17.\n\nThis bullish view will invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and plunges below the 20-day EMA.\n\nXLM/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe bears are trying to halt the recovery at the overhead resistance at $0.13 but the bulls have not given up much ground. The rebound off the 20-EMA shows that lower levels continue to attract buyers. If the price maintains above the overhead resistance, the pair could start an up-move to $0.15.\n\nIf bears want to prevent the up-move, they will have to quickly drag the price below the 20-EMA. That could accelerate selling and tug the price to the 50-SMA.\n\nRelated: 3 reasons why Pepe price will continue to fall in September\n\nMonero price analysis\n\nMonero (XMR) has held the uptrend line support for the past few days, indicating buying at lower levels. The price has reached the 20-day EMA ($143), which is an important level to keep an eye on.\n\nXMR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nIf bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest the start of a sustained recovery. The XMR/USDT pair could then climb to the 50-day SMA ($151), where the bears may again mount a strong defense. If this obstacle is cleared, the pair could surge to $160.\n\nThe bears are likely to have other plans. They will try to protect the 20-day EMA and pull the price below the uptrend line. If they manage to do that, several stops may be hit. That could sink the pair to $130.\n\nXMR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe price action on the four-hour chart shows the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears.\n\nIf the price slips below the 50-SMA, the bears will try to pull the pair to the support line of the triangle. Contrarily, if the price rises above the 20-EMA, the pair could reach the resistance line. A break above or below the triangle could signal the start of a trending move.\n\nMaker price analysis\n\nMaker (MKR) has been stuck between the moving averages, indicating indecision among the bulls and the bears. A minor positive in favor of the bulls is that the price has been trading above the downtrend line.\n\nMKR/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe 20-day EMA ($1,119) is moving up gradually but the RSI near the midpoint suggests a lack of bullish momentum. Buyers will have to propel and sustain the price above the 50-day SMA ($1,157) to signal the start of an up-move to $1,227.\n\nThis positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price re-enters the downtrend line. The MKR/USDT pair could then slump to the strong support at $980. This level is likely to witness strong buying by the bulls.\n\nMKR/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nThe four-hour chart shows that the price has been oscillating between $1,083 and $1,170 for some time. The flattish moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone indicate a slight advantage to the sellers.\n\nOn the downside, the important support to watch out for is $1,102 and then $1,083. Conversely, if the price turns up from the current level and breaks above the moving averages, it will suggest that the bulls are on a comeback. The pair may then rally to $1,170.\n\nThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

        "title": "Bitcoin starts week below US$26,000; Ether dips after hack on Vitalik Buterin's X account; more rate hike worries on ... - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "There was red ink across the crypto market Monday morning in Asia as Bitcoin dipped below the resistance level of US$26,000. Ether also fell to near the US$16,000 mark after a hack on the X account of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged losses. Solana\u2019s SOL led the losers with a 24-hour slide of over 6%. Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX could soon get the greenlight to liquidate its US$3.4 billion in crypto holdings, adding to selling pressure in the market. U.S. stock futures traded higher after Wall Street logged weekly losses Friday. Investors now look ahead to the release of more U.S. inflation data later in the week for clues on upcoming interest rate policy.\n\nLatest FTX news depresses crypto market\n\nBitcoin dipped 0.25% in the last 24 hours to US$25,831.97 as of 07:50 a.m. in Hong Kong. It lost 0.53% for the week, according to CoinMarketCap data. The world\u2019s leading cryptocurrency briefly traded above US$26,000 last Friday. But it soon lost that support level and remained range bound over the weekend at around US$25,900.\n\nEther, the Ethereum blockchain\u2019s native token, fell 1.12% to US$1,616.79, and dropped 1.18% over the past seven days.\n\nEthereum founder Vitalik Buterin\u2019s account on X, formerly Twitter, was hacked Sunday, leading to losses totalling around US$691,000 for some of Buterin\u2019s followers, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. Hackers posted links to a scam non-fungible token (NFT) project on Buterin\u2019s Twitter page, advising users to connect their crypto wallets before withdrawing the funds.\n\nButerin\u2019s father confirmed in a tweet Sunday that his son had been hacked and was restoring his X account. The alleged scam post has now been removed from the account. Buterin himself is yet to comment on the hack.\n\nAll other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies posted losses in the past 24 hours. Solana led the losers, falling 6.17% to US$18.25 for a weekly loss of 6.80%.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Sunday, a Wall Street Journal report predicted a September pause in the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hiking cycle. The report \u201cprobably had many investors re-thinking their valuations \u2014 not just for crypto but for risk assets in general,\u201d said Justin d\u2019Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock.\n\nThe market is also facing downward pressure from the latest FTX news. The collapsed cryptocurrency exchange is likely to receive approval on Sept.13 to start liquidating its crypto holdings, according to a tweet Saturday from blockchain analysts Whale Alert.\n\n\ud83d\udea8POTENTIALLY BIG SELLING NEXT WEEK\n\n\n\nCrypto exchange FTX will likely get approval to liquidate its assets 13th of September.\n\n\n\nThey had $3.4b worth of crypto in April.\n\nCurrent proposed plan is to sell up to $200m worth of crypto every week. \u2014 Whale (@WhaleChart) September 9, 2023\n\nAfter filing for bankruptcy in November 2022, the exchange still holds an estimated US$3.4 billion worth of crypto assets. Part of the bankruptcy plan set up for the firm allows for the sale of up to US$100 million in crypto assets per week, which can be extended to US$200 million under certain circumstances.\n\nCrypto analysts suggest the news could weigh on the market after gains earlier in the summer. Blockchain research firm IntoTheBlock tweeted Sunday that \u201cdespite positive news about Visa and a potential spot ETH ETF, FTX\u2019s impending US$3 billion liquidation could be dictating market movement.\u201d\n\nThe selling pressure from FTX will cause altcoins to underperform Bitcoin throughout the remainder of the year, Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in a Sunday LinkedIn post.\n\nThe potential selling of FTX\u2019s crypto holdings could hit Solana particularly hard, according to Rachael Lucas, crypto technical analyst at Australia-based crypto exchange BTC Markets. The token \u201cforms a substantial portion of these assets, with an estimated value of approximately $685 million. This impending event has heightened the sense of uncertainty among SOL investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin is on the verge of a \u201cdeath cross\u201d \u2014 where the token\u2019s short-term, 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) moves below its long-term, 200-day SMA. That could signal a coming slide in Bitcoin prices, Lucas said.\n\nAs of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, Bitcoin\u2019s 50-day SMA sat at US$27,658.19, with a 200-day SMA of US$27,608.57. Following the previous Bitcoin death cross on Jan.14, 2022, the token\u2019s price dropped over 10% within seven days.\n\n\u201cThe looming question that occupies the minds of market participants pertains to whether Bitcoin will chart a similar course in response to this bearish technical pattern or has the market already priced in this event?\u201d Lucas said.\n\n\u201cThis uncertainty is exacerbated by the forthcoming release of U.S. inflation figures, with technical indicators currently signalling the potential for further downside,\u201d she added.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dropped 0.74% in the past 24 hours to US$1.04 trillion. Trading volume rose 50.61% to US$20.25 billion.\n\nInvestors await key US inflation data as China slump slows\n\nImage: Getty Images\n\nU.S. stock futures edged up as of 11:00 a.m. in Hong Kong. All three major U.S. indexes closed moderately higher on Friday but logged weekly losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the winners on Friday with a 0.22% uptick, but ended the week 0.86% lower.\n\nThe main stock indexes in Asia were mixed on Monday morning. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite and South Korea\u2019s Kospi moved higher. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropped 1.38% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 also posted a 0.19% loss.\n\nThe U.S. consumer price index (CPI) for August will be released on Wednesday. Analysts expect the inflation gauge to rise 3.8% year-on-year, up from 3.2% in July, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland last Friday.\n\nA recent rise in oil prices and stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. services recorded last week have fueled inflation concerns in the U.S., Reuters reported Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that the CPI print could come in higher than expected (with) the price of oil pushing higher,\u201d Phil Blancato, chief executive officer of U.S.-based investment advisory firm Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, said in the report.\n\n\u201cWe have a problem where ultimately the Fed may be pushed into a corner, and while they might take a pause because of the lag effect, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re done,\u201d said Blancato.\n\nThe CPI prediction of 3.8% is still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term goal of reducing the annual inflation rate below 2%. The Fed raised the interest rate in July to between 5.25% and 5.50%, the highest level since early 2001.\n\nThe U.S. CPI data on Wednesday is unlikely to affect Fed thinking ahead of its September meeting, Mohamed A. El-Erian, an adviser to Germany-based financial services firm Allianz, tweeted on Monday. But it could influence future rate decisions, beginning November, he said.\n\nTwo items lead the week ahead for the global #economy and #markets:\n\nAn @ECB meeting where I put the probability of a 25 basis point hike at 55% (yes, it\u2019s that close); and\n\nThe US CPI #inflation print which is unlikely to alter in any significant way the high expectation that\u2026 \u2014 Mohamed A.
