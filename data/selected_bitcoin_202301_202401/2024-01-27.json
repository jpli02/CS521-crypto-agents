        "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency , has weathered recent market volatility with resilience, bouncing back 5% to hit the $42,000 mark on Saturday. Despite this recovery, Bitcoin remains 14% below its post-ETF approval highs.On January 24, Bitcoin was at $39,500, down nearly 20% from around $49,000 \u2014 the three-year high it hit on January 11 in the wake of the decision by the US SEC to approve spot bitcoin ETFs.Siddhartha Gupta, SVP - Business and Strategic Alliances, CoinDCX said, \"Bitcoin's dip below $40,000 post-ETF launch isn't solely due to the event. A prior 15% surge in less than 20 days pushed it into overbought territory. The decline reflects profit booking by major crypto players rather than signalling long-term negativity.\"\"With the imminent halving and potential ETH ETF approvals, our medium and long-term perspective for Bitcoin is bullish and we can look at newer 1-year highs in a short-term period,\" Siddhartha said.In early trade on Saturday, Bitcoin was trading over 5% higher at $42,003. Also, as per reports, over $4 billion of funds have flowed into the new spot bitcoin ETFs, particularly to products operated by BlackRock and Fidelity.Parth Chaturvedi, investments lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, highlighted the success of spot BTC ETFs, attracting a remarkable $4.8 billion in inflows within their initial days. Notably, BlackRock leads with almost $1.8 billion in Bitcoin holdings, followed closely by Fidelity with an additional $1.5 billion. Chaturvedi underscores the potential for sustained demand driven by these ETFs and anticipates upward price pressure, particularly with the upcoming Bitcoin supply halving in April.Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, notes that the recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has triggered a surge in the cryptocurrency landscape, with both Bitcoin and Altcoins experiencing a rally. Despite a market dip due to profit-booking and GrayScale outflows, Bitcoin has maintained its position at the $40,000 level, reflecting confidence from institutional and retail investors.Patel predicts substantial inflows of $5-7 billion in the next three months, with a broader perspective foreseeing institutional commitment and potential inflows reaching $500 billion within 2-5 years.Avinash Shekhar, co-founder and CEO of Pi42, draws parallels with the historic ascent of the SPDR Gold Trust in 2004, signalling a growing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin within the traditional financial ecosystem. Shekhar sees BlackRock's achievement of a $1 billion holding in just four days as indicative of a significant shift in the investment landscape.(Subscribe to ETMarkets WhatsApp channel (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "title": "Crypto may have become boring, but it still isn't legit - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nIt was easy to poke fun at crypto back in late 2022. The market had tanked by about two-thirds in the space of a year; many of the industry\u2019s biggest companies and coins had collapsed into oblivion, their flagrant practices exposed; and the bubble that had driven receipts for pixelated images of apes (remember NFTs?) to sell for millions of dollars had burst. Longtime critics like me were being encouraged to take virtual victory laps, while the crypto crew had egg, clearly, all over their laser-eyed faces.\n\nJust over a year later, however, poking fun might seem less straightforward. Crypto prices have recovered significantly, with the market valuation having roughly doubled over the past twelve months. Earlier this month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission approved the listing of 11 spot bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs), giving investors exposure to the cryptocurrency via regulated products that can be bought and sold like stocks, and are issued by some of the best-established asset managers. Meanwhile, Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, the biggest asset manager in the world and one of those offering a bitcoin ETF, has become something of bitcoin evangelist, calling it \u201can asset class that protects you\u201d.\n\nIs it time for the likes of me to admit we were wrong? Was the approval of the ETFs a game-changer? Is crypto now kind of . . . legit?\n\nThe hyperbole has come in thick and fast, certainly. \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable to suggest that [the SEC\u2019s approval] may be the biggest development on Wall Street in 30 years,\u201d Michael Saylor, executive chair of software-company-turned-crypto hoarder MicroStrategy, told Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe significance of this moment cannot be overstated,\u201d gushed Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive of crypto firm Ripple on X. \u201cToday\u2019s news is further legitimisation of crypto as an asset class,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd yet despite these lofty proclamations, and the fact that this was heralded as a landmark event by both the crypto and mainstream press, what has happened is distinctly dull. The only tiny glimmer of excitement came when the SEC\u2019s X account was compromised, meaning the ETFs\u2019 approval was announced ahead of time. We haven\u2019t suddenly found out the true identity of bitcoin\u2019s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. There is no newfangled initialised asset class on offer that can magic up money out of thin air (before NFTs, you might remember ICOs, STOs, and IEOs).\n\nNo, all that happened is that crypto has gone from being an exciting and rebellious alternative to traditional finance, a way of \u201cbeing your own bank\u201d, to simply providing a means for regular investors to diversify their portfolios and for asset managers to eke out a bit of extra revenue.\n\nCrypto in 2024 is, in other words, rather boring. But boring does not equal legitimate, as SEC chair Gary Gensler himself pointed out when the announcement was made. The commission\u2019s approval of the bitcoin ETFs was not an endorsement of bitcoin or crypto more widely, but rather the result of a court ruling that found the SEC\u2019s long-standing opposition to bitcoin ETFs \u2014 on the grounds they could be subject to fraud and manipulation \u2014 was arbitrary.\n\nIn a statement, Gensler said that \u201cthough we\u2019re merit neutral, I\u2019d note that . . . bitcoin is primarily a speculative, volatile asset that\u2019s also used for illicit activity including ransomware, money laundering, sanction evasion, and terrorist financing\u201d.\n\nFor context, some of the other ETFs that have been approved by the SEC include the \u201cGod Bless America\u201d ETF (ticker: \u201c$YALL\u201d), an anti-woke \u201cinvestment for God-fearing, flag-saving conservatives\u201d; the \u201cInverse Cramer\u201d ETF (SJIM) that aims to invest in the opposite of whatever TV personality Jim Cramer recommends; and a \u201cVICE\u201d ETF (VICE) that invests in \u201cvice-related business activities\u201d.\n\nPlus, it\u2019s not as if boring crypto is all there is now. For anyone who feels bereft of the non-boring variety, there is still plenty of that. For instance, the online pastor charged with civil fraud earlier this month after he and his wife created and sold a cryptocurrency to Christians, telling them God had told him directly they would get rich if they bought it. He has since said it\u2019s possible he \u201cmisheard God\u201d, and has also defended himself by saying that although it\u2019s true that he and his wife pocketed $1.3mn, some of that was spent on a \u201chome remodel that the Lord told us to do\u201d.\n\nThe truth is that, whether the crypto is encased in a nice regulated wrapper and sold to you by BlackRock, or whether you buy it from a pastor who says that the Lord told him to make the sale, there is still no there there. So while it might be more difficult these days, I will continue doing what I consider to be God\u2019s real work: taking the mickey out of it.\n\njemima.kelly@ft.com"
