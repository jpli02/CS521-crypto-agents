        "content": "Famed investor and ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood expects trillions of investor dollars will flow into spot bitcoin ETFs and the digital-asset industry at large in the next decade.\n\nWood predicts about $20 trillion in the bitcoin market and $5 trillion in ethereum potentially by 2030, pointing to an increase in institutional investment in bitcoin, as well as a wider acceptance of use cases for digital assets by traditional financial firms.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re somewhere between one and one-and-a-half trillion [dollars] for the ecosystem,\u201d said Wood while speaking on a panel for a New York press event on Tuesday. \u201cWe see that scaling to $25 trillion in the next five to 10 years.\u201d\n\nAlthough the cryptocurrency industry has been plagued by fraud and companies imploding, firms pursuing the launch of a spot bitcoin ETF are banking on broader adoption of bitcoin and ethereum by the traditional financial markets.\n\nSo far, the Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected all bids for a spot bitcoin ETF, but the agency is currently in talks with firms to work toward a potential approval. The discussions follow the SEC\u2019s loss of a watershed court case to Grayscale Investments in August, when judges ruled the agency had been wrong to block Grayscale\u2019s application to convert its bitcoin trust into an exchange-traded fund.\n\nWood Predicts Investor Enthusiasm for Bitcoin ETF\n\nIn an interview with etf.com Tuesday, Wood said she believes institutional investors will turn toward bitcoin when they see its value.\n\n\u201cTypically, institutions will tiptoe in with one percent\u2026then they\u2019ll get more educated and intrigued and build their positions the more they understand,\u201d she explained. Wood expects between 2% and 6.5% of institutional allocation into bitcoin in this time frame.\n\nShe also noted that investors can use bitcoin as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, pointing to investors looking towards bitcoin in reaction to the regional banking crisis this past spring.\n\nStory continues\n\nContact Lucy Brewster at lucy.brewster@etf.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermalink | \u00a9 Copyright 2023 etf.com.

        "content": "Ark Invest's Cathie Wood has long been bullish on the cryptocurrency space. She's still optimistic that Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) could trade somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million.\n\nWhat To Know: Bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of the year as optimism surrounding a potential spot Bitcoin ETF continues to rise. Wood believes the rally in Bitcoin is just getting started.\n\nIn an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, Wood predicted that Bitcoin would trade up to $650,000 per coin, but that's just her base case. In a bull case scenario, the world's largest cryptocurrency could be worth between $1 million and $1.5 million per coin, she said.\n\n\"Last year, a lot of people thought that the bankruptcy of FTX, Celsius and Three Arrows was going to be the end of Bitcoin. And quite the opposite happened,\" Wood said.\n\nMore and more people are starting to understand that FTX was a centralized organization, lacking transparency. Bitcoin is the exact opposite of that, she said.\n\nBitcoin is decentralized and has a network of developers watching over it, preventing fraud like what we saw with FTX, she explained.\n\n\"When FTX went down, the bitcoin blockchain didn\u2019t skip a beat, the Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) network didn\u2019t skip a beat. It was as though it didn\u2019t happen,\" Wood told the Journal.\n\nCheck This Out: EXCLUSIVE: Crypto Industry Insider Predicts Bitcoin Spot ETF In Early 2024 \u2014 Why It's 'Not Entirely Priced In'\n\nThe Ark Invest CEO suggested that a spot Bitcoin ETF could help push prices higher. It would make it easy for the average person to gain exposure to the asset, she said.\n\nAn ETF would be regulated and offer protection. It would also be much less complicated than using Coinbase Global Inc (NASDAQ: COIN) to buy Bitcoin, she said.\n\nCoinbase is one of Ark's biggest holdings. At the time of writing, it was actually the top holding in the Ark Innovation ETF (ARCA:ARKK) with a 9.06% weighting.\n\nThe crypto exchange is currently facing an SEC lawsuit claiming the company is an unregistered broker, but Wood isn't worried.\n\nThe SEC has been on the losing side of several similar cases and if Coinbase were to lose, she believes the company would appeal the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court, given its importance.\n\n\"We need real legislation if this truly is a new asset class, so that\u2019s really what the question is here,\" Wood told WSJ.\n\n$BTC Price Action: Bitcoin is up approximately 119% year-to-date. It was last up 0.64% over a 24-hour period at $36,386 at the time of writing, per Benzinga Pro.\n\nRead Next: Cathie Wood Slams Portfolio Managers' Index-Based Investing As She Highlights Existential Threat Google, A Top Holding, Faces From LLMs\n\nWatch Cathie Wood\u2019s recent interview on \u201cThe Raz Report\u201d below.\n\nPhoto: Ark Invest and Shutterstock\n\n\u00a9 2023 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 Crypto Stocks to Buy Before the 2024 Bitcoin Halving - Nasdaq",
        "content": "According to crypto experts, the ongoing bear market has come to an end after almost two years. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) prices have more than doubled year-to-date, while Ethereum (ETHUSD) has surged close to 70% in 2023. Moreover, two key near-term drivers could drive cryptocurrency prices higher in the next 12 months.\n\nFirst is the Bitcoin halving event, which is expected to take place in April 2024. The total number of Bitcoin that can be mined is limited to 21 million, and the halving process reduces the rewards for mining - which is intended to control the supply of cryptocurrency on the market and limit inflation. The halving typically acts as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin. For instance, between November 2015 and November 2017, BTC prices surged by 2,000%, while they spiked almost 600% between November 2019 and November 2021.\n\nAnother significant event for cryptocurrencies could be the upcoming launch of multiple spot Bitcoin exchanged traded funds (ETFs). Several investment managers, including BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ), have applied to introduce their own version of a spot Bitcoin ETF, which seems increasingly likely to be approved by the SEC in the next six months. BlackRock has close to $10 trillion in assets under management, and even if it allocates 1% of funds toward Bitcoin, it could result in inflows worth $100 billion.\n\nIt seems the time is ripe to invest in Bitcoin and related crypto assets right now. While you can purchase BTC and other cryptocurrencies directly from exchanges like Coinbase (COIN), another way to gain exposure to this area of the market is by investing in BTC mining companies. Here are three crypto stocks to consider buying before the 2024 Bitcoin halving event.\n\nTeraWulf Stock\n\nValued at $222 million by market cap, TeraWulf (WULF) develops, owns, and operates Bitcoin mining facility sites in New York and Pennsylvania. In Q3 of 2023, TeraWulf self-mined 611 BTC and realized another 13 BTC via hosting profit share. Its revenue rose to $19 million in Q3, up from $15.5 million in the year-ago period.\n\nThe total value of the self-mined Bitcoin stood at $27.9 million, while the power cost per Bitcoin rose 29% to $9,322 due to a 13% increase in network difficulty. TeraWulf reported adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) of $9 million, an increase of 19% year over year.\n\nOut of the five analysts tracking WULF, four recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The average target price for WULF is $3.65, which is 244% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nHive Digital Technologies Stock\n\nHive Digital Technologies (HIVE) is another Bitcoin mining company, valued at $249 million by market cap. HIVE reported revenue of $22.8 million in Q3 and mined 801 BTC. Its gross operating profit stood at $4.6 million, indicating a margin of 20%.\n\nThe number of BTC mined during the quarter fell by 6.6% year over year. Similar to TeraWulf, HIVE's revenue was impacted by increased mining network difficulty, which means more miners were competing with better equipment for the opportunity to mine the maximum number of Bitcoin. HIVE recently purchased 4,800 Bitmain S19k Pro ASIC miners, allowing it to upgrade a portion of its fleet to improve mining efficiency.\n\nOut of the three analysts tracking HIVE, two recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cmoderate buy.\u201d The average target price for HIVE is $6.83, which is 127% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nRiot Blockchain Stock\n\nThe final Bitcoin mining stock on my list is Riot Blockchain (RIOT), valued at $2 billion by market cap. Among the largest BTC mining companies in the world, Riot reported revenue of $51.9 million in Q3, as it mined 1,106 Bitcoin during the quarter.\n\nThe company has mined a total of 4,996 BTC in 2023 with an average cost of just $5,537 per Bitcoin, which indicates Riot is a leading low-cost producer of the digital asset. Riot ended Q3 with $290 million in cash and 7,327 BTC worth $500 million, providing it with the liquidity to ride out an uncertain macro environment.\n\nOut of the eight analysts tracking RIOT, six recommend \u201cstrong buy,\u201d one recommends \u201cmoderate buy,\u201d and one recommends \u201cstrong sell.\u201d The average target price for RIOT is $16.78, which is 65% above the current trading price.\n\nwww.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Aditya Raghunath did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.
