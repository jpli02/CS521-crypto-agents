It was down less than 1% to $27,460, after the momentary breach of the lower end of the roughly $30,000 to $27,000 range that it has been in trading in for the past month."

        "content": "The apparent exit or reduction in trading by Jane Street and Jump Crypto, two influential cryptocurrency market makers, has the potential to disrupt the fragile flow of liquidity across the industry, an analyst at Kaiko told CoinDesk.\n\nJane Street and Jump are paring back crypto trading in the U.S., Bloomberg reported Tuesday, amid the regulatory clampdown that spawned out of FTX's collapse in November. Jump's crypto division will continue to expand globally while Jane Street will scale back on its growth plans, Bloomberg reported.\n\n\"The news is not necessarily surprising given recent developments,\" Kaiko analyst Riyad Carey told CoinDesk. \"What's concerning is that liquidity has still not recovered from Alameda's collapse, and a slowdown with two of the biggest surviving market makers could weigh on liquidity even further. It's a bit surprising how slow the industry has been to fill Alameda's shoes.\"\n\nMarket depth, a metric used to measure liquidity on exchanges by assessing how much capital is required to move a market, slumped by more than 50% following the collapse of FTX and has failed to recover despite a rise in crypto prices.\n\nCrypto-native market makers, unlike traditional firms such as Jane Street and Jump, aren't put off by the duo's exodus as the issue is constrained to the U.S. market.\n\n\"Not a big impact yet,\" Zahreddine Touag, Head of Trading at Paris-based market market Woorton, told CoinDesk. \"In the short term, some exchanges will be less liquid but more importantly it will be more difficult for US counterparties to source OTC liquidity.\"\n\n\"We might see it in the future if brokers, payment providers and other actors looking to source liquidity start shifting offshore or to Europe and Asia,\" he added.\n\nThe United States' gung-ho stance on crypto regulation has already attracted criticism from the likes of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, but the long-lasting effects are potentially far greater than any short-term tremble.\n\nAn absence of liquidity, which is what the crypto industry will experience as several market makers jump ship, causes an increase in volatility as it takes less capital to move an asset. This, coupled with this highly-leveraged nature of crypto markets, has the potential to create a credit risk that could spread to all sectors of finance."

At the time, Twitter said that 130 accounts were targeted.\n\nThe hackers tweeted from those accounts falsely claiming that they would double all bitcoin sent to them in the next 30 minutes. Binance \u2013 the world's largest crypto exchange \u2013 also saw its account compromised.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hackers' tweet from Joe Biden's account.

Swatting refers to the act of calling the police on an innocent person and falsely claiming criminal activity.\n\n\"O'Connor's criminal activities were flagrant and malicious, and his conduct impacted multiple people's lives. He harassed, threatened, and extorted his victims, causing substantial emotional harm,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite, Jr. of the Justice Department's Criminal Division.\n\nO'Connor pleaded guilty to multiple counts of stalking, computer intrusion, extortion, money laundering, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 23 and faces a maximum sentence of more than 70 years in prison."

Liquidity is becoming a concern after major market makers Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto quit cryptocurrency trading in the U.S. citing unfavorable regulations. Ether led the losers in the top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, while Pokadot led the winners.

The token neared US$1,900 on Wednesday before falling back to as low as US$1,795.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded mixed, with Polkadot\u2019s Dot token leading the winners with a gain of 1.91% to US$5.45. However, it\u2019s down 5.43% for the week. Web3 Foundation, the organization behind the Polygon blockchain, testified before the U.S. Congress on Wednesday on digital asset regulations, calling for a clearer rules of the road.\n\nThe total crypto market capitalization dipped 0.30% in the past 24 hours to US$1.14 trillion. The total trading volume rose 43.61% to US$45.84 billion.\n\nNFT index dips\n\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed by CryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\n\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index dipped 0.67% to 3,440.57 in the 24 hours to 10:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, losing 6.15% for the week.\n\nMilady Maker, an Ethereum-based NFT collection, topped the 24-hour sales across the market after Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Twitter and Tesla, tweeted on Wednesday an image containing the NFT.\n\nMilady Maker\u2019s sales totaled over US$9.54 million in the past 24 hours, a surge of over 3,700%, according to data by CryptoSlam, with its floor price jumping 38.4% to 4.69 ETH (US$8,609), according to CoinGecko.\n\nBoosted by the rise of Milady Maker, NFT sales on the Ethereum blockchain jumped 89.41% in the past 24 hours to US$34.25 million, according to CryptoSlam.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged up 0.04%. The S&P 500 futures gained 0.19%. And the Nasdaq Composite futures added 0.16%.\n\nThe three U.S. indexes closed mixed in regular trading on Wednesday as investors digested the U.S. consumer price index report that showed annual inflation unexpectedly slowed to 4.9% in April from 5% in March, the slowest pace in the past two years. The moderate cooling of inflation indicates the Federal Reserve may take a pause in its more than year-long cycle of raising rates to slow inflation.\n\nOn talks to raise the U.S. debt ceiling to keep the government solvent, President Joe Biden warned on Wednesday that a federal government default could trigger a global recession, according to a Bloomberg report. Biden is set to continue talks to raise the debt ceiling on Friday, with congressional Republicans demanding more budget cuts in any agreement.\n\nOn other data releases, the U.S. producer price index and jobless claims come out Thursday to offer further insights into the health of the economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will meet on June 14 to decide its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5 and 5.25%, the highest since 2006. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 96.1% chance the Fed will keep rates unchanged in June, and a 3.9% chance for another 25 basis-point rate hike, down from 21.2% on Wednesday.\n\n(Updates with equity section.)\n\nSee related article: Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Moody\u2019s, others to join new financial industry blockchain"
