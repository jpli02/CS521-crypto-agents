Similar to previous US spot Bitcoin ETF filings in the past few weeks, the updated application says that Fidelity expects to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a US cryptocurrency exchange."

        "content": "Asset management giant Fidelity Investments is again trying to launch a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund, according to a Thursday filing.\n\nThe move comes two weeks after BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, which has long been opposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOther firms appear to have taken BlackRock's filing as a sign that the SEC's stance could soon change. Since then, WisdomTree, VanEck and Invesco have taken the initial steps toward their own funds. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest filed for changes to its proposed bitcoin fund Wednesday that brought it closer in line with BlackRock's application.\n\nThursday's filing is a proposed rule from the Cboe BZX Exchange to list the Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, the name of Fidelity's previously proposed bitcoin ETF that was denied by the SEC. The exchange has made similar filings for other firms over the past two weeks.\n\nThe SEC has so far rejected every spot bitcoin fund application on which it has made a decision. The commission is in a legal battle with Grayscale about its decision to block the conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. A decision in that case is expected later this year.\n\nOne of the SEC's key concerns about a spot bitcoin product is transparency in the market and the potential for manipulation. The BlackRock filing includes a proposed surveillance-sharing agreement that could alleviate those concerns. The subsequent filings have similar proposals.\n\nThe SEC has already allowed the creation of ETFs that track bitcoin futures contracts, including the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) that has more than $1 billion in assets. The first leveraged bitcoin futures fund hit the market Tuesday.\n\nThe new rush for ETFs appears to have buoyed prices for bitcoin. The digital currency was trading near $30,500 Thursday afternoon, up from below $26,000 prior to the BlackRock filing."

        "title": "What Is a Bitcoin ETF, and Why Does Everyone from Blackrock to Fidelity Want One? - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "With more mainstream popularity than ever, many new people are interested in acquiring some Bitcoin. But many of the crypto-curious still view buying Bitcoin from a crypto exchange as an intimidating and opaque process. The technical aspects of holding Bitcoin\u2014such as crypto wallets, Bitcoin addresses and private keys\u2014are confusing to newcomers, and scare some investors away.\n\nAll of this has intensified the appeal of a Bitcoin ETF, or exchange-traded fund. Major financial institutions like Blackrock, Fidelity, and Invesco have applied with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch ETFs.\n\nWhat is an ETF?\n\n\ud83d\udcb8 An ETF is an investment vehicle that is publicly traded, like a stock, but tracks the performance of an underlying asset or index, rather than one company.\n\n\ud83d\udee2\ufe0f An ETF is a way for investors to get exposure to the value of its underlying asset, like gold or oil.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 ETFs trade on a traditional stock exchange, and their value should rise when the asset increases in price, and fall when it decreases.\n\nSEC Approves First Leveraged Bitcoin Futures ETF\n\nThe first ETF launched in 1993, and they became popular as a way for retail investors to invest in a basket of assets at once. If you wanted to invest in 500 of the largest companies in America at once, you could buy shares in a S&P 500 ETF.\n\nA Bitcoin ETF works in much the same way as any other ETF. Investors buy shares in the ETF through whatever brokerage they buy stocks, and can trade them the same way they'd trade shares in Apple or Tesla.\n\nThe 2x bitcoin ETF $BITX has become effective, scheduled to launch Tuesday. I was doubtful it would happen but looks like it\u2019s official. Could this be early sign of SEC lightening up? After $BITO launch I believe they made earlier 2x filers withdraw pic.twitter.com/XXxSt9xypu \u2014 Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 23, 2023\n\nBitcoin ETFs track the current price of Bitcoin, and should act in lockstep with Bitcoin's price swings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy the need for a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nSo, why wouldn\u2019t investors just buy Bitcoin?\n\nFor most regular retail investors, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general still look risky.\n\nBesides having unclear regulations around them, owning Bitcoin requires keeping a Bitcoin wallet and trusting crypto exchanges, which are still uncharted territory for people unfamiliar with the space and require a certain level of self-education.\n\nHolding Bitcoin places the burden of security squarely on you, making you responsible for keeping your own private keys safe (unless you want to entrust them to the exchange). This may mean buying a hardware wallet to protect purchased Bitcoin, or storing private keys in a secure manner. You\u2019d also have to work out how to file taxes for sales of Bitcoin that resulted in capital gains.\n\nHow To File Your Crypto Taxes In The U.S.\n\nWith a Bitcoin ETF, investors need not worry about private keys, storage, or security. They own shares in the ETF just like their shares of stock, and can gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market without having to go through the hoops of purchasing and holding crypto.\n\nAnd to put it plainly, that is an extremely appealing proposition for many regular folks\u2014as well as sophisticated institutional investors.\n\nThat's why so many hedge funds and other investment firms have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for Bitcoin ETFs. Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss were first out of the gate with an application for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust in 2013. In 2018, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the Winklevoss brothers a patent for \u201cexchange-traded products.\" But the SEC still hasn't approved their ETF\u2014or any others.\n\nHow does a Bitcoin ETF work?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that buys and holds the actual Bitcoin; the price is pegged to the Bitcoin held in the fund. The firm lists the ETF on a traditional stock exchange, and you, the investor, trade the ETF just as you would any other stock. Bitcoin ETFs also offer new types of trading opportunities, including short-selling, where investors can bet against Bitcoin.\n\nBut there are also some key differences between a Bitcoin ETF and other ETFs.\n\nFirst, some ETFs, like those that track the S&P 500, represent equity shares, so you get a cut of the dividends that any company in the ETF pay to their shareholders. When Tesla pays a dividend and you have shares in an ETF that includes Tesla, you get a (smaller) dividend. Bitcoin is decentralized, so that won't happen with a Bitcoin ETF.\n\nSecond, just like with other ETFs, you have to pay fees to the company offering the ETF. But with a Bitcoin ETF, some portion of your fees would go to paying the custody and management fees for the purchase and storage of the Bitcoin that underlies the ETF.\n\nA brief history of Bitcoin ETF progress\n\nWhat\u2019s so special about a Bitcoin ETF?\n\nA Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. is expected to bring a new level of mainstream trustworthiness and acceptance to Bitcoin investing. In 2020 and 2021, big publicly traded companies including Square and Tesla bought Bitcoin as an investment for their balance sheets, which spurred new adoption\u2014but the cryptocurrency is still seen by many conservative investors as a risky bet or even a gimmick.\n\nThe approval of a Bitcoin ETF by the SEC would mean that institutional investors can more easily speculate on the price of Bitcoin. It would functionally bring Bitcoin to Wall Street, with the Bitcoin ETF traded through the same places as Tesla stock, bonds, gold, oil, or any other traditional assets.\n\nAnd it would likely be a huge boost to the price of Bitcoin.\n\nCannabis ETFs have become popular for many of the same reasons that Bitcoin ETFs have. Just like crypto, the marijuana industry is viewed as risky and uncertain by traditional investors who still want the opportunity to profit from it.\n\nBitcoin Price Stable Despite BitMEX Arrests and Trump's COVID Diagnosis"
