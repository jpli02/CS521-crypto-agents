        "title": "VanEck files 5th amendment to spot Bitcoin ETF under 'HODL' - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Asset manager VanEck filed a fifth amended application for a spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Dec. 8.\n\nAccording to the regulator\u2019s database, the amended filing to the S-1 Form with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) highlights updates to the VanEck Bitcoin Trust. A spot Bitcoin ETF is an investment vehicle that lets people buy shares in a fund that tracks the price of Bitcoin.\n\nThe VanEck ETF is now expected to be listed under \u201cHODL,\u201d which is a misspelling of \u201chold\u201d or an acronym for \u201chold on for dear life.\u201d Bitcoiners use the phrase to describe a strategy of buying and never selling the digital asset.\n\nI like this play\u2026\n\n\n\nRetail who knows crypto space will love the ticker.\n\n\n\nBoomers will have no idea what it means, so won\u2019t attract negative attention on advisor statements (plus a lot of advisors preach \u201cHODL\u201d in other asset classes anyways).\n\n\n\nGood straddle here. \u2014 Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 8, 2023\n\nVanEck\u2019s ticker symbol for the spot Bitcoin ETF got the attention of analysts on X (formerly Twitter). Nate Geraci, president of the advisory firm The ETF Store, commented that people familiar with crypto will appreciate the ticker, except boomers who won\u2019t understand it. He said the ticker would help avoid negative attention on adviser statements, as many advisers already advocate hodling in different asset classes.\n\nAccording to Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst, the ticker symbol choice differs from the \u201cmore boring Boomer-y choices\u201d other companies like BlackRock and Fidelity go for. He suggested that the ticker symbol choice is a unique approach by VanEck.\n\nVanEck itself also got in on the fun by posting a comment on Dec 8:\n\n\u201cMy #Bitcoin ETF will bring all the baby boomers to the yard, *if approved.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bitcoin new high set for late 2024, Binance to lose top spot \u2014 VanEck\n\nSeveral companies, including BlackRock, Fidelity, VanEck, Valkyrie and Franklin Templeton, are in the race for an approved spot Bitcoin ETF. While the SEC hasn\u2019t indicated its support for the filings, it has engaged in recent discussions with representatives from the applicant firms to address technical details in their fund proposals.\n\nVanEck anticipates SEC approval for a Bitcoin ETF spot in January and estimates $2.4 billion in inflows in Q1.\n\nMagazine: Asia Express: HTX hacked again for $30M, 100K Koreans test CBDC, Binance 2.0"

        "title": "Bitcoin dominance threatens 'likely top' despite BTC price eyeing $45K - Cointelegraph",
        "content": "Bitcoin (BTC) risks \u201crolling over\u201d to cancel its latest uptrend, new analysis warns as altcoins surge.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 9, popular analyst and social media commentator Matthew Hyland flipped cautious on BTC price action.\n\nBitcoin dominance risks violating key level\n\nBitcoin bulls kept momentum hot into the end of the week\u2019s Wall Street trading as BTC/USD sealed new 19-month highs of $44,729 on Bitstamp on Dec. 8.\n\nData from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView tracked a subsequent return below the $44,000 mark, with Bitcoin cementing itself in an intraday range.\n\nBTC/USD 1-hour chart. Source: TradingView\n\nFor Hyland, however, there are more sinister signs that the bull run may be in trouble after robust 60% gains since the start of October.\n\nThe smoking gun, he says, lies in Bitcoin\u2019s share of the overall crypto market cap.\n\n\u201cDominance is rolling over as per the bear divergence that was noted. Has given back all the gains from the move up the other day,\u201d he wrote in the X post.\n\n\u201cIf it breaks and closes below 51.81 it would be the first lower low in over a year and an end to the uptrend, along with a likely top put in.\u201d\n\nBitcoin crypto market cap dominance annotated chart. Source: Matthew Hyland/X\n\nHyland referred to the recent spike in Bitcoin dominance, which on Dec. 6 hit 55.26% \u2014 its highest level since April 2021. A swift turnaround saw upside progress unwind, with dominance at 53.4% at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin crypto market cap dominance 1-week chart. Source: TradingView\n\nAltcoins extend intraday gains\n\nOthers believe that such a dominance reversal will allow altcoins to commence a major rally of their own \u2014 a phenomenon commonly known as \u201caltseason.\u201d\n\nRelated: Price analysis 12/8: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, ADA, DOGE, AVAX, LINK, MATIC\n\nThis looked to be in motion already on the day, with the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap led by Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX), which both gained 22% in 24 hours.\n\nOnly the largest altcoin, Ether (ETH), was treading water while still being up 12% over the past seven days. ADA and AVAX also constituted the week\u2019s leaders, with gains passing 50%.\n\nETH/USD 1-day chart.

When dominance really starts dropping is when we see the face melting alt season we all know and love.\u201d\n\nAltcoin market cap 1-day chart.

        "title": "Bitcoin: Do the Biggest Price Swings Happen on Weekends? - Investopedia",
        "content": "2022 Price Changes 2023 Price Changes 2022 Volume Changes 2023 Volume Changes Sunday -0.27% 0.53% 3.86% 12.21% Monday 0.02% 0.12% 47.65% 59.56% Tuesday -0.06% 0.97% 3.69% 2.75% Wednesday -0.27% 0.06% 2.93% 11.49% Thursday -0.20% -0.37% -0.42% 0.67% Friday -0.64% 0.48% 7.34% 1.72% Saturday -0.21% 0.13% -31.11% -36.60%\n\nBitcoin's average price changes (by midnight) in 2022 tended to drop from the previous midnight, but you'll notice that Friday night's change was the most significant drop, while Mondays was the most significant increase.\n\nIt should also be remembered that 2022 was often called a \"crypto winter\" as prices continued dropping through the year, somewhat mirroring the stock market, influenced by downward market pressures. Bitcoin's prices tend to follow stock market trends but are much more exaggerated in the short term.\n\nDuring 2023, all but Thursday's average price changes were positive by midnight. Average volume changes for both years demonstrate that volumes tended to drop on weekends as professional traders stopped trading. On Sundays, some traders were active, increasing volume from the night before. Mondays suggest professional traders got back to work as average trading volumes rose significantly and continued to rise throughout the work week.\n\nInterpreting the Price and Volume Data\n\nIt's difficult to discern if volume changes occur for reasons other than the days of the week professional traders are working, but it's a good bet that traders of all kinds are taking some time off during the weekend.\n\nIt also appears that bitcoin's market price doesn't change much (percentage-wise) regardless of the changes in trading volume\u2014but given the price of one bitcoin, even a price change of 0.5% could be a few hundred dollars.\n\nSo, what does all this mean for weekend traders? Less volume usually means lower liquidity and fewer opportunities in a market already touted as less liquid than other markets. But there are opportunities to make large profits on the weekends trading bitcoin.\n\nThe image below shows prices on Saturday, Dec. 9, 2023, in one-minute increments. On this particular Saturday, there were some opportunities for large profits from increases but also some significant drops that could cause massive losses. Between 8:30 and 9:10, the price dropped from about $44,200 to $43,760\u2014about $440 in less than 40 minutes. Several hours later, it nearly recovered, then dropped again by a few hundred dollars.\n\nTradingView\n\nA trader who can take advantage of movements like these could walk away with a significant profit, but the chances of losing a large amount are just as high.\n\n\n\nIs It Good To Trade Bitcoin on the Weekends? Bitcoin prices are as volatile on the weekend as during regular trading hours, but there is much less volume. Trading Bitcoin is always risky, but weekend trading adds more risk. If you can tolerate the risk and stick to your strategy, you could still trade profitably on weekends.\n\nCan I Trade Bitcoin on the Weekends? Cryptocurrency markets are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so you can trade bitcoin on the weekend.\n\nDoes Bitcoin Go Up on the Weekends? There is no pattern of price climbs on weekends, but prices can rise and fall significantly within minutes.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCryptocurrency trading is an around-the-clock activity, giving you the flexibility to trade anytime. Weekends may be a good time to trade if you're busy throughout the week and don't have time to trade\u2014there are opportunities to profit.\n\nHowever, it is important to understand that trading volume was generally lower on weekends in 2022 and 2023 while prices continued rising and falling. Lower volume lessens liquidity in a market that is already somewhat low, and the cryptocurrency market can turn on a dime. But for the trader who can tolerate risks and stick with their strategy, Bitcoin weekend trading provides some excellent (but risky) opportunities.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Spotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\nSpotlight Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Bitcoin recently hitting $44K for the first time since April 2022, time is running out to buy crypto\u2019s cheap before the bull run sends prices soaring. However, identifying the projects with the highest potential is challenging. We\u2019ve considered tokenomics, use cases, market trends, hype, and partnerships to provide the best eight cryptos to buy now. Let\u2019s explore each of them.Our top pick for the best crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run is Bitcoin ETF Token . Typically, Bitcoin-related tokens perform well alongside the market leader. However, the newly launched presale Bitcoin ETF Token offers a one-of-a-kind use case and is closely tied to the widely anticipated Bitcoin ETF approvals.The project features multiple tools to reward holders as the Bitcoin ETFs are approved. The most hyped is its deflationary mechanism, which drives scarcity and fear of missing out (FOMO) into the project, potentially skyrocketing its price.Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s burn mechanism is two-fold. First, it has allocated 25% of its total supply to be burned across five key Bitcoin ETF Milestones. Second, it features a 5% burn tax on transactions, which will be reduced by 1% at each milestone.It also boasts a staking mechanism which currently offers a 97% APY. Presale buyers can start staking and compounding their investment immediately, but they must be quick as the rewards decrease as more people stake tokens.The project also offers Bitcoin ETF alerts via its website, updating users on the latest industry news. This will help foster and retain an active and engaged community.Bitcoin ETF Token\u2019s presale is quickly nearing its $4.9 million hard cap after raising $2.7 million in one month. Meme Kombat is a revolutionary meme coin-cross GambleFi token, providing an innovative use case, robust tokenomics, and a position at the cusp of two of crypto's most prominent trends.The project enables users to gamble on AI-generated battles between meme coin characters. It boasts numerous game modes, massive community rewards, and traditional odds mechanics, making for a truly immersive gambling experience.Essentially, this use case adds a gamified meme coin allure to the exciting crypto casino trend, which has seen significant success recently.Users must wager with the $MK token, creating a steady and predictable demand stream to help the price grow.On the other hand, much of the supply will be locked up in the project\u2019s lucrative staking mechanism. Currently, stakers can garner a 333% APY, this will decrease as the staking pool grows, similar to Bitcoin ETF Token.Another massively bullish factor is the project\u2019s security. It features a doxxed team, with its founder\u2019s details available on its website. Furthermore, blockchain security firm Coinsult recently conducted a smart contract audit , which found the $MK token is secure and not at risk of hacks or exploits.Investors can buy the Meme Kombat presale for $0.225, but they must hurry because its price will rise in just over one day.Avalanche is a scalable and decentralised layer 1 blockchain boasting a vast ecosystem. The project focuses mainly on DeFi and crypto gaming, two of crypto's most promising use cases.The AVAX price has recently begun a solid upward trajectory, currently trading at $26.26 and up 25% this week. As such, it has fared as the best-performing top 10 crypto, ahead of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, indicating a growing bullish narrative around the project.Moreover, AVAX has surged over 100% this month, solidifying its current trajectory. That said, there remains significant room for growth in the bull run, with its market cap at less than $10 billion.Avalanche could climb significantly higher in the upcoming bull run because its ecosystem is arguably expanding faster than any other. The project has seen adoption from leading financial institutions like JP Morgan and Citi. Meanwhile, tier-one games like Shrapnel, Blitz, and Off The Grid are all building on the network.This is significantly bullish for the AVAX coin since it is used for staking and will be the primary currency to transfer value and pay network transaction fees, providing significant demand as adoption grows.After a meteoric rise to become the third largest meme coin in the recent bear market, Pepe suffered a drawn-out pullback, dropping from highs of $0.000004354 on 6 May to $0.0000006446 in October.However, a renewed excitement surrounding the project caused its price to spike and break its bearish trajectory. Pepe reached highs of $0.000001141 on 10 November and then underwent another almost month-long consolidation.Yet, in recent days, the price has broken its consolidation resistance trend line, catapulting it 40% this week and making it one of the top-performing meme coins.$PEPE is currently up 8.5% on the last day, priced at $0.000001534, and could continue to recover during the Bitcoin bull run.Taking a long-term outlook, Pepe holds tremendous upside potential. It has a $640 million market cap, providing room for almost 3x growth to its ATH. Meanwhile, it presents room for nearly 8x to catch Shiba Inu by market cap and almost 20x to Dogecoin,opening the door to monumental gains for Pepe.Alongside its price increase, Pepe\u2019s trading volume has also surged recently. Currently, it is at $490 million. This is higher than Shiba Inu\u2019s, which is currently at $466 million and not far behind Dogecoin\u2019s $1.2 billion, despite a significantly lower market cap. TG Casino is a pioneering new crypto casino offering anonymous and secure gambling directly from the Telegram application, as seen on sites like Techopedia and Rakeback.com.Launching on Telegram provides various usability advantages, like a simplified betting process, end-to-end encryption, and access to Telegram\u2019s one billion users.Meanwhile, the project is KYC-free, and users only need to connect their wallets to start. This makes the Casino seamless, providing a massive advantage over market leader Rollbit, which is criticised for its complex signup process.The $TGC token also provides numerous advantages to holders, like free rewards, access to exclusive games and rooms, 25% cashback on losses, up to 200% rakeback, and a 173% staking APY.This creates a notable demand source that will push up the $TGC price. Meanwhile, it also features a cutting-edge buyback mechanism, repurchasing $TGC tokens from the open market with a portion of the casino\u2019s revenue.It will burn 40% of tokens and allocate 60% to staking rewards, making $TGC deflationary while rewarding holders in line with the casino\u2019s success.These factors amount to significant price potential, as highlighted by esteemed influencer Eric Cryptoman, who said it could be a \u201ctop runner\u201d once it launches on exchanges.Investors can buy TG Casino at presale for $0.175 but must hurry as its price will rise shortly.Another presale crypto offering a revolutionary use case is Bitcoin Minetrix . The project has raised $4.9 million in two months, indicating tremendous community interest.Bitcoin Minetrix enables users to mine Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform. Users stake their $BTCMTX tokens for mining credits, which they can burn for cloud mining power.This process enables anyone to mine Bitcoin, a tremendously powerful use case - especially considering the upcoming Bitcoin halving and anticipated price hike it will incur.Since it is based on cloud mining, users do not require hardware or specialist knowledge, and there are no overhead costs. Moreover, its decentralised and transparent $BTCMTX token eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams.Another advantage is there are no space or noise constraints for the user.All these factors provide immense value to Bitcoin mining, potentially moving the industry toward mass adoption, and $BTCMTX could therefore benefit from the next Bitcoin bull run.Moreover, the $BTCMTX token is central to the operation, with users requiring it for staking. This equates to a significant demand stream. Meanwhile, supply will be scarce since tokens will be locked for staking, and rewards will be paid out in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.IOTA is a well-established cryptocurrency that was deemed an Ethereum\u2013competitor in the 2017 bull run. However, it seemingly lost steam in the last bull market as its price failed to create a new ATH.Nevertheless, IOTA has gathered significant momentum recently, up 75% this week, with a $900 million market cap and price of $0.304.That said, it retains tremendous room for growth, currently 94% from its December 2017 ATH of $5.69.This could be a good crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run because its recent pump indicates a growing interest and potential trend reversal. Meanwhile, its upside potential is vast and boasts robust fundamentals.IOTA aims to build an \u201cInternet of Things\u201d leveraging a unique network architecture called \u201cThe Tangle,\u201d which makes the network more scalable as more people use it.It will integrate real-world items into the blockchain, providing a fast and secure distributed network where data can flow seamlessly and securely.There are infinite potential use cases for the project. Some of the most talked about are supply chain management, digital identities, and a \u201cdigital twin,\u201d which tracks the lifecycle of a real-life object such as a car, helping reduce the risk of fraud in the used car market.While many other top cryptos have experienced massive bullish momentum in recent weeks, XRP has remained relatively stable, up roughly 30% since October.It is currently priced at $0.617, with a $33 billion market cap.Yet, the exciting thing about the current XRP price is that it is just 20% higher than before its landmark partial victory over the SEC in its lawsuit.The currency was ruled not a security by the court, providing an unprecedented degree of legal clarity not present in any other crypto. Immediately, XRP\u2019s price spiked to upwards of $0.8 but pulled back after the SEC appealed the court\u2019s decision.Nevertheless, the court denied the SEC\u2019s appeal, but the price did not react as expected. Instead, it has consolidated between $0.58 and $0.62 while the rest of the market has soared.Given XRP\u2019s growing regulatory certainty, compelling use case as a global bridge currency for digital payments, and its market-leading partnerships, its price could be gearing for a tremendous pump in the coming weeks.This is furthered by its recent inactivity, increasing its upside potential relative to other cryptos that have already pumped."

TG Casino is a pioneering new crypto casino offering anonymous and secure gambling directly from the Telegram application, as seen on sites like Techopedia and Rakeback.com.Launching on Telegram provides various usability advantages, like a simplified betting process, end-to-end encryption, and access to Telegram\u2019s one billion users.Meanwhile, the project is KYC-free, and users only need to connect their wallets to start. This makes the Casino seamless, providing a massive advantage over market leader Rollbit, which is criticised for its complex signup process.The $TGC token also provides numerous advantages to holders, like free rewards, access to exclusive games and rooms, 25% cashback on losses, up to 200% rakeback, and a 173% staking APY.This creates a notable demand source that will push up the $TGC price. Meanwhile, it also features a cutting-edge buyback mechanism, repurchasing $TGC tokens from the open market with a portion of the casino\u2019s revenue.It will burn 40% of tokens and allocate 60% to staking rewards, making $TGC deflationary while rewarding holders in line with the casino\u2019s success.These factors amount to significant price potential, as highlighted by esteemed influencer Eric Cryptoman, who said it could be a \u201ctop runner\u201d once it launches on exchanges.Investors can buy TG Casino at presale for $0.175 but must hurry as its price will rise shortly.Another presale crypto offering a revolutionary use case is Bitcoin Minetrix . The project has raised $4.9 million in two months, indicating tremendous community interest.Bitcoin Minetrix enables users to mine Bitcoin by staking $BTCMTX on its Ethereum-based platform. Users stake their $BTCMTX tokens for mining credits, which they can burn for cloud mining power.This process enables anyone to mine Bitcoin, a tremendously powerful use case - especially considering the upcoming Bitcoin halving and anticipated price hike it will incur.Since it is based on cloud mining, users do not require hardware or specialist knowledge, and there are no overhead costs. Moreover, its decentralised and transparent $BTCMTX token eradicates the risk of cloud mining scams.Another advantage is there are no space or noise constraints for the user.All these factors provide immense value to Bitcoin mining, potentially moving the industry toward mass adoption, and $BTCMTX could therefore benefit from the next Bitcoin bull run.Moreover, the $BTCMTX token is central to the operation, with users requiring it for staking. This equates to a significant demand stream. Meanwhile, supply will be scarce since tokens will be locked for staking, and rewards will be paid out in mining credits, not $BTCMTX.IOTA is a well-established cryptocurrency that was deemed an Ethereum\u2013competitor in the 2017 bull run. However, it seemingly lost steam in the last bull market as its price failed to create a new ATH.Nevertheless, IOTA has gathered significant momentum recently, up 75% this week, with a $900 million market cap and price of $0.304.That said, it retains tremendous room for growth, currently 94% from its December 2017 ATH of $5.69.This could be a good crypto to buy ahead of the next bull run because its recent pump indicates a growing interest and potential trend reversal. Meanwhile, its upside potential is vast and boasts robust fundamentals.IOTA aims to build an \u201cInternet of Things\u201d leveraging a unique network architecture called \u201cThe Tangle,\u201d which makes the network more scalable as more people use it.It will integrate real-world items into the blockchain, providing a fast and secure distributed network where data can flow seamlessly and securely.There are infinite potential use cases for the project. Some of the most talked about are supply chain management, digital identities, and a \u201cdigital twin,\u201d which tracks the lifecycle of a real-life object such as a car, helping reduce the risk of fraud in the used car market.While many other top cryptos have experienced massive bullish momentum in recent weeks, XRP has remained relatively stable, up roughly 30% since October.It is currently priced at $0.617, with a $33 billion market cap.Yet, the exciting thing about the current XRP price is that it is just 20% higher than before its landmark partial victory over the SEC in its lawsuit.The currency was ruled not a security by the court, providing an unprecedented degree of legal clarity not present in any other crypto. Immediately, XRP\u2019s price spiked to upwards of $0.8 but pulled back after the SEC appealed the court\u2019s decision.Nevertheless, the court denied the SEC\u2019s appeal, but the price did not react as expected. Instead, it has consolidated between $0.58 and $0.62 while the rest of the market has soared.Given XRP\u2019s growing regulatory certainty, compelling use case as a global bridge currency for digital payments, and its market-leading partnerships, its price could be gearing for a tremendous pump in the coming weeks.This is furthered by its recent inactivity, increasing its upside potential relative to other cryptos that have already pumped."
