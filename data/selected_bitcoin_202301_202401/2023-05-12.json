        "title": "Weekly Market Wrap: Bitcoin dips to US$26,166 as memecoins flood the blockchain - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "Bitcoin fell 9.42% from May 5 to May 12 to trade at US$26,365 as of 7:30 p.m. on Friday in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been trading under US$30,000 since April 19. Ether fell 7.3% over the week to US$1,765, losing the key US$1,800 support level.\n\nimage 3\n\nThe U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) released this week showed slower headline inflation in April, boosting hopes for the Federal Reserve to pause rate hikes next month. U.S. annual inflation slowed to 4.9% last month, from 5% in March, but gained 0.4% on the month.\n\nBitcoin briefly topped US$28,300 following the release of U.S. inflation data, but has since been trading lower.\n\n\u201cBitcoin dropped to US$26,900 after rejecting from the ~US$28,200 area. The reaction from the ~US$26,900 area was quite strong,\u201d tweeted pseudonymous crypto analyst Rekt Capital. \u201cThe US$28,200 resistance is the resistance to beat if the price is to enjoy bullish momentum,\u201d he added.\n\nThe global crypto market capitalization stood at US$1.1 trillion on Friday at 07:30 p.m. in Hong Kong, down 8.33% from US$1.2 trillion a week ago, according to CoinMarketCap data. Bitcoin\u2019s US$510 billion market cap accounted for 46.3% of the market, while Ether\u2019s US$214 billion accounted for 19.4%.\n\nBitcoin stuck in traffic\n\nIn another milestone for the world\u2019s first blockchain, the number of non-zero balance Bitcoin addresses reached an all-time high of 46.6 million on Thursday, boosted by the surging interest in Ordinals, a protocol that allows data to be inscribed in the smallest monetary unit of Bitcoin, according to on-chain data analytics firm Glassnode.\n\nAs a result, Bitcoin congestion issues worsened. The network faced a growing backlog of transactions exacerbated by the network surpassing 5 million Ordinals inscriptions, fueled by the arrival of memecoins in the form of BRC-20 tokens, a fungible token standard built on Ordinals protocol. BRC-20 tokens surpassed US$1 billion in market capitalization on Tuesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdding to the negative market sentiment, Binance temporarily halted Bitcoin withdrawals twice in 12 hours on Monday, due to a \u201clarge volume of pending transactions.\u201d The world\u2019s largest crypto exchange resumed Bitcoin withdrawals on the same day, while Bitcoin fell as low as US$27,419 on Monday.\n\n\u201c[The correction] was highly due to that since Binance witnessed historically-high BTC outflows,\u201d said Leena ElDeeb, a research associate at 21.co, the parent company of 21Shares, an issuer of crypto exchange-traded products.\n\nBitcoin supply on exchanges fell to a five-year low of 5.84% on Tuesday, according to crypto analytics firm Santiment, indicating that long-term holders are increasingly opting for self-custody solutions.\n\n\u201cThe downtrend was also influenced by misinformation on Twitter, calling the congestion a denial of service attack when, in fact, it was increased demand that led to that congestion and skyrocketing transactions only meant that people were willing to pay more money for faster settlements,\u201d ElDeeb added.\n\nNilesh Verma, crypto market analyst and founder of Crypto Granth consultancy in India, pointed to a separate thread of inaccurate information dissemination surrounding the U.S. government and its Bitcoin holdings as a significant factor in the declining value of Bitcoin this week.\n\nMisinformation emerged on Wednesday, stating that the U.S. government started selling its Bitcoin holdings. According to a March 31 court filing, the U.S. government seized 51,351.89 Bitcoin (worth US$1.4 billion) from Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the darknet marketplace Silk Road. The government sold 9,861 Bitcoin (US$279 million) on March 14 and is planning to sell the remaining 41,490 Bitcoin (US$1.1 billion) in four batches this year.\n\n\u201cSomeone shared fake news that the U.S. government will sell Bitcoin by showing the wrong labeling on the Arkham Platform\u2026 same we saw on April 27, when Bitcoin dropped from US$29,000 to US$27,000 on a glitch in the Arkhram platform,\u201d Verma said.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nCrypto Granth\u2019s Verma said that Bitcoin has strong support around US$26,111. \u201cBitcoin has to hold this support for continued bullish momentum. As of now, we can see a retest of this area. We believe that we will see strong buying near US$25,000-26,000. Weekly closing below US$26,000 will make Bitcoin bearish,\u201d wrote Verma.\n\nBut Dr. Jeff Ross, founder and chief executive officer of investment firm Vailshire Capital Management, said Bitcoin needs to dip lower before starting a new rally.\n\n\u201cShort-term momentum indicators need one more flush lower, ideally to US$24,000, to complete the healthy reset and begin the next leg higher, starting in mid-to-late May,\u201d wrote Ross on his verified Twitter account.\n\nBiggest gainers:\n\nKava, the governance token of a layer-1 blockchain of the same name, was this week\u2019s biggest gainer among the top 100 coins by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Kava rose 17% to US$0.9204, after the protocol announced that its mainnet launch is one week away.\n\nBitcoin SV (BSV) \u2013 a fork of Bitcoin Cash focused on scalability \u2013 was this week\u2019s second biggest gainer, rising 8.47% to US$35.88. The token saw a surge of interest after congestion on the Bitcoin network caused transaction fees to rise .\n\nSee related article: Central Banks\u2019 actions move Crypto; Standard Chartered eyes $100K Bitcoin\n\nNext week: All eyes on the U.S. debt ceiling\n\nNegotiations over raising the U.S. debt ceiling of US$31.4 trillion to keep the government solvent continued on Wednesday, with congressional Republicans demanding more budget cuts. President Biden\u2019s meeting with top Congress leaders planned for Friday was postponed to next week, three sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.\n\nInvestors are also anticipating Europe\u2019s Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices report, scheduled for next Wednesday. Euro area annual inflation for April is expected to come in at 7% for April, up from 6.9% in March, according to flash estimates from Eurostat, the European Union\u2019s statistical office.\n\nIn the crypto space, liquid Ether staking protocol Lido Finance is preparing for its V2 upgrade, enabling Ether and staked Ether (stETH) withdrawals directly on the protocol. The Lido DAO is set to vote for the V2 upgrade starting today, from 10 p.m. Hong Kong time. With the community\u2019s approval, the upgrade is expected to go live next Monday.\n\nWeb 3.0 gaming protocol Gala Games is also preparing for a contract upgrade on Monday. The protocol will issue its new Gala V2 token in a 1:1 ratio for all Gala token holders, while support and utility for the initial token will cease simultaneously. While most major exchanges signaled their support for the new token, Coinbase stated that it will not be supporting Gala V2.\n\nSee related article: Crypto and NFT Market Update \u2013 May 11th"

        "title": "Crypto Winter 2022 Cost Bitcoin ($BTC) Holders More Than Cash - Bloomberg",
        "content": "Tales From the Crypto Winter Some acolytes lost faith, others blamed devils\u2014and some went even harder. An essay exploring what happens when the prophecy of blockchain fails.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day in early 2021, my old friend George called. I always enjoyed our catch-ups. We\u2019d usually talk about dating, movies and his screenwriting career. But this time he steered the conversation toward a new topic: Bitcoin.\n\nGeorge, whose surname I\u2019m omitting to protect his privacy, seemed genuinely eager for me to learn about the cryptocurrency. He sent me podcasts featuring blockchain \u201cexperts\u201d and chart-heavy newsletters about \u201con-chain analytics.\u201d George was planning his financial future around Bitcoin, he told me, and didn\u2019t want his friends to get left behind. For a while, I ignored his appeals\u2014the whole thing seemed complicated and vaguely annoying. But as the price of Bitcoin rose, his messages became more insistent. I agreed to look into it, and after \u201cdoing my own research,\u201d i.e., half-listening to a few podcasts set on 2x speed, I decided to buy some.\n\nA series of cascading implosions caused the value of crypto to plummet last year. After that, George and I had a very different conversation. \u201cLet me issue a blanket apology here,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was the blind leading the blind.\u201d Indeed, since I\u2019d bought it, Bitcoin had lost three-quarters of its value. We were deep in what the blockchain faithful are calling crypto winter\u2014an extended downturn that has yet to thaw.\n\nFor George, apologizing to me wasn\u2019t the hardest part. He\u2019d persuaded his Chinese immigrant parents to refinance their mortgage and lend him $50,000 to invest in Bitcoin. He stored the funds on Celsius, a sort of crypto bank where they could accrue interest. The company collapsed into bankruptcy, and now the money was frozen, much of it likely lost. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019m deeply ashamed, and I will commit ritual seppuku if you demand it,\u2019 \u201d he says. They didn\u2019t, but he said he plans to pay them back when he can.\n\nIt seemed that George, like a lot of us who got caught up in crypto, was experiencing not just a financial loss but a kind of financial grief\u2014a tangle of guilt, second-guessing and that awful feeling of having fallen for something. Bitcoin\u2019s price has bounced back some since we spoke, but that\u2019s little comfort if you\u2019ve had your money stuck on a janky platform such as Celsius, or lost funds on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s allegedly fraudulent FTX exchange, or held one of the now-worthless \u201caltcoins\u201d that popped up like mushrooms in a big rain during the pandemic trading boom. For many, crypto had become an identity, a way to feel smart and subversive and on the cutting edge of a new technology. What happens to that self-image when its foundation erodes? When instead of being someone\u2019s savvy son or daughter, you are the sheepish adult child who has to explain where the family savings went? (Disclosure: I haven\u2019t sold the tokens\u2014mostly Bitcoin and Ether\u2014that I bought near the top of the bull market, making me the object of delicate inquiry and gleeful mockery at family gatherings.)\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. George, despite the frauds, the constant hacks and the market\u2019s collapse, says he still has faith. \u201cI still believe blockchain is a revolutionary development,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 10, 20, 50 years, I do believe\u2014I want to believe, badly\u2014that we\u2019ll look back and say Bitcoin was an invention on the scale of the printing press or the internet.\u201d\n\nIn their seminal 1956 social psychology study, When Prophecy Fails, Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter described how followers of a doomsday cult responded when their prophet\u2019s precise predictions of apocalypse turned out to be false: They just pushed the date back. Some became even stronger believers and proselytized more. They\u2019d already committed too much, perhaps quitting their jobs or giving away money, to accept that there was nothing to it. The study became a classic example of the \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d that occurs when evidence contradicts one\u2019s model of the world.\n\nI was curious how people in crypto were handling the dissonance. In the summer of 2021, with blockchain fervor in full swing, I wrote an article about crypto communities and found it useful to divide them into factions based on their favorite investment. There were the Bitcoin maximalists, who thought the OG token was the one true way to resist the scourges of modern finance and government; Ethereum hobbyists who regarded blockchains as a nifty Lego set for building new widgets; DeFi (decentralized finance) day traders who just gambled for the buzz. Each group came with its own values and culture. Today it feels more apt to sort people by their narratives of what the hell happened to crypto and where it all goes from here.\n\nTHE DOUBLE-DOWNERS\n\nAt a dude-heavy meet-up at a Midtown bar in New York in January, a group stood in a circle debating what had gone wrong with crypto. One guy blamed the large amount of \u201cfluff\u201d in the market, because anyone could spin a token out of nothing. Another pointed to the lack of transparency in many crypto institutions. A trader named Boris Friedman said that while people are currently \u201cfearful\u201d of crypto because of FTX, he expects the market to rebound in the next three to five years. \u201cLong term, there will be more adoption,\u201d he said.\n\nNearby, Corey Wilson, wearing two necklaces\u2014one featuring the Egyptian Eye of Ra, the other the logo for a blockchain called HEX\u2014sipped a margarita. Wilson told me that after losing funds on the crypto scam BitConnect and then making it all back and more with HEX, he still buys tokens every day. \u201cI see a higher upside now that we\u2019re in the lows of the market,\u201d he said. (HEX is down almost 90% from its peak.)\n\nWilson buys tokens every day. Photographer: Levi Mandel for Bloomberg Businessweek He sports a necklace with the logo of a favorite token. Photographer: Levi Mandel for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRich Etienne, an engineer in Florida who lost about $100,000 in the Celsius collapse, said in a phone interview that he has a good feeling about the market now. He says it\u2019s a matter of watching for patterns in the charts\u2014\u201clittle movements, fake-outs, certain people shilling.\u201d It\u2019s less science than art, he says: \u201cYou start to get the vibe that this is it.\u201d\n\nA Dutch institutional investor-turned-Bitcoin analyst who goes by the handle \u201cPlan B\u201d is best known for his charts predicting that Bitcoin would pass $100,000 in 2021. When that didn\u2019t happen, his reputation took a hit. \u201cYou see a lot of hate,\u201d Plan B told me over Zoom. (Like many crypto influencers, he prefers to be identified by his handle out of concern for his safety.) He stands by his optimistic analysis, particularly his popular \u201cstock-to-flow\u201d model that predicts Bitcoin will continue trending upward as the issuance of new coins slows, as it was programmed to do by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. (The model assumes Bitcoin\u2019s price is driven by scarcity, a logic familiar to gold bugs as well as Beanie Babies collectors.) Plan B now estimates that by 2028, Bitcoin will be worth $100,000 to $1 million, up from about $27,000 today. The date, in other words, moved back a few years. \u201cFor me it\u2019s the long game,\u201d he says. He adds that his bet on Bitcoin is all-or-nothing: \u201cIt\u2019s either going to zero or it\u2019s going to be the successor to the US dollar.\u201d\n\nAcademics say this type of thinking\u2014doubling down on one\u2019s conviction, despite a crash\u2014is consistent with the psychology of both trading and gambling. Investors are more apt to sell assets that have gained in value than to let go of ones that have dropped; it\u2019s a phenomenon known as the disposition effect. There are different explanations for this, says Tobin Hanspal, assistant professor of finance at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. One is that traders with plunging assets become risk-loving because they feel they have nothing to lose. Another says they\u2019re avoiding feelings of regret. People \u201cdo not want to admit defeat or face the realization that they made a mistake,\u201d Hanspal says. (This is me.)\n\nBlec blames the collapse on \u201ctoo much trust.\u201d Photographer: Tamara Reynolds for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOthers keeping the faith describe the crash as a purge that proves crypto must return to its roots. The whole point of Bitcoin, according to Satoshi\u2019s white paper, was to allow people to transact money directly with \u201cno central authority\u201d like a government or bank, or a company such as FTX or Celsius. This idea of decentralization has a totemic power for some, with a resonance that seems as much emotional as intellectual.\n\nChris Blec, who writes an online newsletter called the Blec Report, has made a career out of criticizing any crypto project that deviates from the original purpose of blockchain technology. Companies such as FTX were \u201cabusing Satoshi\u2019s invention,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re using it in ways it\u2019s not intended to be used.\u201d Blec argues that most of the projects that collapsed over the past year suffered from the same problem: \u201ctoo much trust.\u201d Any system that requires trusting human beings is inherently unstable, he says, and can create a bubble. \u201cEvery time it bursts,\u201d he says, \u201cmore people understand that.\u201d\n\nThose Who Knew\n\nFrances Coppola wasn\u2019t always a crypto hater. \u201cWhen Bitcoin first came out, I was quite keen on it,\u201d she says. The UK-based writer on economics and banking had long seen a need for an alternative to the bank-based payment system, and cryptocurrencies seemed like a promising development. But by 2021 she\u2019d turned skeptic. That summer she posted a Twitter thread explaining why even decentralized crypto systems run by code could be prone to catastrophic failure. She argued that they\u2019d suffer digital bank runs if investors started to pull their money out quickly, which their algorithms wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. \u201cThe algos are built on the assumption that humans never panic and stampede for the exit, ignoring the overwhelming evidence that they do,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHer tweets caught the attention of Do Kwon, the creator of TerraUSD, a then-hot coin that used a decentralized algorithm to maintain a steady value of $1. TerraUSD was a popular substitute for US dollars among DeFi traders, and it could be reinvested to earn high yields. \u201cI don\u2019t debate the poor on Twitter,\u201d Kwon tweeted in Coppola\u2019s thread.\n\nCoppola foresaw the crypto panic. Photographer: Jack Kenyon for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u201cSchadenfreude is the right term\u201d\n\n\u201cThat came back to haunt him,\u201d Coppola says. \u201cI ended up being cited in the court case.\u201d She then bursts into a merry laugh. In May 2022, TerraUSD unraveled in exactly the type of bank run Coppola had described. Kwon is now being sued by investors and has been charged with fraud by US prosecutors; he\u2019s denied wrongdoing. For Coppola, the crash, which TerraUSD\u2019s fall partly triggered, has been bittersweet. She doesn\u2019t want to take pleasure in it, given how many people have gotten hurt. And yet, \u201cI did feel a bit, \u2018So there,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cSchadenfreude is the right term.\u201d\n\nCoppola belongs to a community of skeptics who have long pushed back against the narratives spread by crypto boosters. During the bull market, many of those boosters swamped the skeptics with derision. \u201cWe did take a lot of abuse from the \u2018Have fun staying poor\u2019 crowd,\u201d she says. Since the crash, the skeptics have taken a victory lap. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say people are opening bottles of Champagne,\u201d says Amy Castor, another prominent crypto critic, who works as a freelance journalist and writes a reader-supported blog. But they\u2019ve seen their ranks grow. \u201cThere were a handful of us before, screaming into the abyss,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there\u2019s a lot more.\u201d\n\nThe Blame-casters\n\nIn crypto, 2022 was the year of the \u201cbad actor.\u201d (As in malefactor, not Steven Seagal.) Bad actors were suddenly everywhere, tainting the purity of the otherwise unassailable technology.

(People in this group are skittish about talking.) After making six figures in the 2021 bull run, he dropped out of college and took a job at a crypto venture capital firm. His thinking was simple, he says: School sucked, and he wanted to be free, make a ton of money and have a Lambo.

        "content": "Tales From the Crypto Winter Some acolytes lost faith, others blamed devils\u2014and some went even harder. An essay exploring what happens when the prophecy of blockchain fails.\n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne day in early 2021, my old friend George called. I always enjoyed our catch-ups. We\u2019d usually talk about dating, movies and his screenwriting career. But this time he steered the conversation toward a new topic: Bitcoin.\n\nGeorge, whose surname I\u2019m omitting to protect his privacy, seemed genuinely eager for me to learn about the cryptocurrency. He sent me podcasts featuring blockchain \u201cexperts\u201d and chart-heavy newsletters about \u201con-chain analytics.\u201d George was planning his financial future around Bitcoin, he told me, and didn\u2019t want his friends to get left behind. For a while, I ignored his appeals\u2014the whole thing seemed complicated and vaguely annoying. But as the price of Bitcoin rose, his messages became more insistent. I agreed to look into it, and after \u201cdoing my own research,\u201d i.e., half-listening to a few podcasts set on 2x speed, I decided to buy some.\n\nA series of cascading implosions caused the value of crypto to plummet last year. After that, George and I had a very different conversation. \u201cLet me issue a blanket apology here,\u201d George said. \u201cIt was the blind leading the blind.\u201d Indeed, since I\u2019d bought it, Bitcoin had lost three-quarters of its value. We were deep in what the blockchain faithful are calling crypto winter\u2014an extended downturn that has yet to thaw.\n\nFor George, apologizing to me wasn\u2019t the hardest part. He\u2019d persuaded his Chinese immigrant parents to refinance their mortgage and lend him $50,000 to invest in Bitcoin. He stored the funds on Celsius, a sort of crypto bank where they could accrue interest. The company collapsed into bankruptcy, and now the money was frozen, much of it likely lost. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry, I\u2019m deeply ashamed, and I will commit ritual seppuku if you demand it,\u2019 \u201d he says. They didn\u2019t, but he said he plans to pay them back when he can.\n\nIt seemed that George, like a lot of us who got caught up in crypto, was experiencing not just a financial loss but a kind of financial grief\u2014a tangle of guilt, second-guessing and that awful feeling of having fallen for something. Bitcoin\u2019s price has bounced back some since we spoke, but that\u2019s little comfort if you\u2019ve had your money stuck on a janky platform such as Celsius, or lost funds on Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s allegedly fraudulent FTX exchange, or held one of the now-worthless \u201caltcoins\u201d that popped up like mushrooms in a big rain during the pandemic trading boom. For many, crypto had become an identity, a way to feel smart and subversive and on the cutting edge of a new technology. What happens to that self-image when its foundation erodes? When instead of being someone\u2019s savvy son or daughter, you are the sheepish adult child who has to explain where the family savings went? (Disclosure: I haven\u2019t sold the tokens\u2014mostly Bitcoin and Ether\u2014that I bought near the top of the bull market, making me the object of delicate inquiry and gleeful mockery at family gatherings.)\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. George, despite the frauds, the constant hacks and the market\u2019s collapse, says he still has faith. \u201cI still believe blockchain is a revolutionary development,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 10, 20, 50 years, I do believe\u2014I want to believe, badly\u2014that we\u2019ll look back and say Bitcoin was an invention on the scale of the printing press or the internet.\u201d\n\nIn their seminal 1956 social psychology study, When Prophecy Fails, Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken and Stanley Schachter described how followers of a doomsday cult responded when their prophet\u2019s precise predictions of apocalypse turned out to be false: They just pushed the date back. Some became even stronger believers and proselytized more. They\u2019d already committed too much, perhaps quitting their jobs or giving away money, to accept that there was nothing to it. The study became a classic example of the \u201ccognitive dissonance\u201d that occurs when evidence contradicts one\u2019s model of the world.\n\nI was curious how people in crypto were handling the dissonance. In the summer of 2021, with blockchain fervor in full swing, I wrote an article about crypto communities and found it useful to divide them into factions based on their favorite investment. There were the Bitcoin maximalists, who thought the OG token was the one true way to resist the scourges of modern finance and government; Ethereum hobbyists who regarded blockchains as a nifty Lego set for building new widgets; DeFi (decentralized finance) day traders who just gambled for the buzz. Each group came with its own values and culture. Today it feels more apt to sort people by their narratives of what the hell happened to crypto and where it all goes from here.\n\nTHE DOUBLE-DOWNERS\n\nAt a dude-heavy meet-up at a Midtown bar in New York in January, a group stood in a circle debating what had gone wrong with crypto. One guy blamed the large amount of \u201cfluff\u201d in the market, because anyone could spin a token out of nothing. Another pointed to the lack of transparency in many crypto institutions. A trader named Boris Friedman said that while people are currently \u201cfearful\u201d of crypto because of FTX, he expects the market to rebound in the next three to five years. \u201cLong term, there will be more adoption,\u201d he said.\n\nNearby, Corey Wilson, wearing two necklaces\u2014one featuring the Egyptian Eye of Ra, the other the logo for a blockchain called HEX\u2014sipped a margarita. Wilson told me that after losing funds on the crypto scam BitConnect and then making it all back and more with HEX, he still buys tokens every day. \u201cI see a higher upside now that we\u2019re in the lows of the market,\u201d he said. (HEX is down almost 90% from its peak.)\n\nWilson buys tokens every day. Photographer: Levi Mandel for Bloomberg Businessweek He sports a necklace with the logo of a favorite token. Photographer: Levi Mandel for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nRich Etienne, an engineer in Florida who lost about $100,000 in the Celsius collapse, said in a phone interview that he has a good feeling about the market now. He says it\u2019s a matter of watching for patterns in the charts\u2014\u201clittle movements, fake-outs, certain people shilling.\u201d It\u2019s less science than art, he says: \u201cYou start to get the vibe that this is it.\u201d\n\nA Dutch institutional investor-turned-Bitcoin analyst who goes by the handle \u201cPlan B\u201d is best known for his charts predicting that Bitcoin would pass $100,000 in 2021. When that didn\u2019t happen, his reputation took a hit. \u201cYou see a lot of hate,\u201d Plan B told me over Zoom. (Like many crypto influencers, he prefers to be identified by his handle out of concern for his safety.) He stands by his optimistic analysis, particularly his popular \u201cstock-to-flow\u201d model that predicts Bitcoin will continue trending upward as the issuance of new coins slows, as it was programmed to do by its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. (The model assumes Bitcoin\u2019s price is driven by scarcity, a logic familiar to gold bugs as well as Beanie Babies collectors.) Plan B now estimates that by 2028, Bitcoin will be worth $100,000 to $1 million, up from about $27,000 today. The date, in other words, moved back a few years. \u201cFor me it\u2019s the long game,\u201d he says. He adds that his bet on Bitcoin is all-or-nothing: \u201cIt\u2019s either going to zero or it\u2019s going to be the successor to the US dollar.\u201d\n\nAcademics say this type of thinking\u2014doubling down on one\u2019s conviction, despite a crash\u2014is consistent with the psychology of both trading and gambling. Investors are more apt to sell assets that have gained in value than to let go of ones that have dropped; it\u2019s a phenomenon known as the disposition effect. There are different explanations for this, says Tobin Hanspal, assistant professor of finance at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. One is that traders with plunging assets become risk-loving because they feel they have nothing to lose. Another says they\u2019re avoiding feelings of regret. People \u201cdo not want to admit defeat or face the realization that they made a mistake,\u201d Hanspal says. (This is me.)\n\nBlec blames the collapse on \u201ctoo much trust.\u201d Photographer: Tamara Reynolds for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nOthers keeping the faith describe the crash as a purge that proves crypto must return to its roots. The whole point of Bitcoin, according to Satoshi\u2019s white paper, was to allow people to transact money directly with \u201cno central authority\u201d like a government or bank, or a company such as FTX or Celsius. This idea of decentralization has a totemic power for some, with a resonance that seems as much emotional as intellectual.\n\nChris Blec, who writes an online newsletter called the Blec Report, has made a career out of criticizing any crypto project that deviates from the original purpose of blockchain technology. Companies such as FTX were \u201cabusing Satoshi\u2019s invention,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re using it in ways it\u2019s not intended to be used.\u201d Blec argues that most of the projects that collapsed over the past year suffered from the same problem: \u201ctoo much trust.\u201d Any system that requires trusting human beings is inherently unstable, he says, and can create a bubble. \u201cEvery time it bursts,\u201d he says, \u201cmore people understand that.\u201d\n\nThose Who Knew\n\nFrances Coppola wasn\u2019t always a crypto hater. \u201cWhen Bitcoin first came out, I was quite keen on it,\u201d she says. The UK-based writer on economics and banking had long seen a need for an alternative to the bank-based payment system, and cryptocurrencies seemed like a promising development. But by 2021 she\u2019d turned skeptic. That summer she posted a Twitter thread explaining why even decentralized crypto systems run by code could be prone to catastrophic failure. She argued that they\u2019d suffer digital bank runs if investors started to pull their money out quickly, which their algorithms wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. \u201cThe algos are built on the assumption that humans never panic and stampede for the exit, ignoring the overwhelming evidence that they do,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHer tweets caught the attention of Do Kwon, the creator of TerraUSD, a then-hot coin that used a decentralized algorithm to maintain a steady value of $1. TerraUSD was a popular substitute for US dollars among DeFi traders, and it could be reinvested to earn high yields. \u201cI don\u2019t debate the poor on Twitter,\u201d Kwon tweeted in Coppola\u2019s thread.\n\nCoppola foresaw the crypto panic. Photographer: Jack Kenyon for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n\u201cSchadenfreude is the right term\u201d\n\n\u201cThat came back to haunt him,\u201d Coppola says. \u201cI ended up being cited in the court case.\u201d She then bursts into a merry laugh. In May 2022, TerraUSD unraveled in exactly the type of bank run Coppola had described. Kwon is now being sued by investors and has been charged with fraud by US prosecutors; he\u2019s denied wrongdoing. For Coppola, the crash, which TerraUSD\u2019s fall partly triggered, has been bittersweet. She doesn\u2019t want to take pleasure in it, given how many people have gotten hurt. And yet, \u201cI did feel a bit, \u2018So there,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cSchadenfreude is the right term.\u201d\n\nCoppola belongs to a community of skeptics who have long pushed back against the narratives spread by crypto boosters. During the bull market, many of those boosters swamped the skeptics with derision. \u201cWe did take a lot of abuse from the \u2018Have fun staying poor\u2019 crowd,\u201d she says. Since the crash, the skeptics have taken a victory lap. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say people are opening bottles of Champagne,\u201d says Amy Castor, another prominent crypto critic, who works as a freelance journalist and writes a reader-supported blog. But they\u2019ve seen their ranks grow. \u201cThere were a handful of us before, screaming into the abyss,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there\u2019s a lot more.\u201d\n\nThe Blame-casters\n\nIn crypto, 2022 was the year of the \u201cbad actor.\u201d (As in malefactor, not Steven Seagal.) Bad actors were suddenly everywhere, tainting the purity of the otherwise unassailable technology. Instead of pointing to structural problems in crypto\u2014the lack of investor protections, say, or the fundamental question of how to prevent a fully decentralized, largely anonymous currency from being used to fund terrorism\u2014believers blamed individuals (or groups) for \u2026 acting badly.\n\nThe baddest actor of all, of course, is the man now known across the cryptosphere as \u201cScam Bankrupt-Fraud.\u201d Molly White, a vocal crypto critic who runs the site Web3 Is Going Just Great, has argued that Bankman-Fried is a useful scapegoat for crypto fans. \u201cIt\u2019s very convenient for them to say, \u2018This isn\u2019t our problem, this is just one guy,\u2019 \u201d she said in a recent podcast interview. (Bankman-Fried, who\u2019s facing criminal fraud charges, has denied wrongdoing.)\n\nOther scapegoats abound. On Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson Tonight, guest host Tulsi Gabbard highlighted an unfounded theory that American politicians were channeling US taxpayer dollars to Ukraine, which was then investing in FTX, which was then funneling money back to Democrats.

(She requested I not use her full name so she can speak candidly about her work.)
