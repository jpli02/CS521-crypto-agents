        "content": "Bitcoin's value could jump to as much as $100,000 by the end of 2024, Standard Chartered said in a note published Monday.\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other mid-tier U.S. lenders has solidified the case for bitcoin as a \"decentralised, trustless and scarce digital asset,\" Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said in the note.\n\n\"We see potential for Bitcoin (BTC) to reach the USD 100,000 level by end-2024, as we believe the much-touted 'crypto winter' is finally over,\" Kendrick said in the report, titled \"Bitcoin \u2014 Pathway to the USD 100,000 level.\"\n\n\"The current stress in the traditional banking sector is highly conducive to BTC outperformance \u2013 and validates the original premise for Bitcoin as a decentralised, trustless and scarce digital asset,\" Kendrick added.\n\n\"Given these advantages, we think BTC's share of total digital assets market cap could move into the 50-60% range in the next few months (from around 45% currently).\"\n\nBitcoin was trading at $27,601.55 as of 9:40 a.m. ET, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThe woes of Circle's USD Coin and other so-called stablecoins, which aim to achieve a 1-to-1 peg to the U.S. dollar, has also benefited bitcoin, Kendrick said.\n\nUSDC lost its peg to the dollar after its issuer Circle revealed exposure to SVB. The coin has since regained its $1 value, however its total market value has fallen to $30.7 billion from more than $43 billion since Mar. 10 when the bank was placed into receivership by the U.S. government, according to CoinGecko data.\n\nThis, coupled with a stabilization of risk assets and speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary tightening further, means the \"pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer,\" Kendrick said.\n\nProponents of bitcoin maintain the digital currency is an asset worth diversifying into in times of economic distress. As the theory goes, bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, meaning it should appreciate as demand for alternative assets grows to avoid the effects of high inflation."

        "title": "'Crypto is dead in America,' says longtime bitcoin bull Chamath Palihapitiya - CNBC",
        "content": "Tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya, who said two years ago that bitcoin has replaced gold and predicted the digital currency would climb to $200,000, has a much more cautious view on cryptocurrencies these days.\n\n\"Crypto is dead in America,\" Palihapitiya said in the latest episode of the All-In podcast.\n\nPalihapitiya blamed crypto's demise largely on regulators, who have gotten much more aggressive in their pursuit of bad actors in the industry. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has said crypto trading platforms should abide by strict U.S. securities laws.\n\nIn answering questions in front of lawmakers recently, Gensler connected the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank with the crypto industry.\n\n\"You had Gensler even blaming the banking crisis on crypto,\" Palihapitiya said. \"The United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto.\"\n\nThe SEC has ramped up its enforcement of the crypto industry, bearing down on companies and projects that the regulator alleges were selling unregistered securities.\n\nIn February, the agency proposed rules that would change which crypto firms can custody customer assets. In March, the SEC issued crypto exchange Coinbase a Wells notice \u2014 typically one of the final steps before it files charges \u2014 warning the company that it identified potential violations of U.S. securities law. Last week, the SEC charged the crypto asset trading platform Bittrex and its ex-CEO with operating an unregistered exchange.\n\nCoinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told CNBC that his company is preparing for a yearslong court battle with the commission, and is also considering relocating outside the U.S. if it doesn't get improved regulatory clarity. Meanwhile, Bittrex has already announced it would wind down U.S. operations specifically due to \"continued regulatory uncertainty.\"\n\nThey \"were probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment,\" said Palihapitiya, referring to crypto companies. \"And they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy.\"\n\n\"Now they're paying the price for that,\" he said. \"The bill has come due for them.\"\n\nGensler faced similar criticism from House Republicans over the agency's crackdown on cryptocurrency platforms during four hours of congressional testimony last week.\n\n\"Regulation by enforcement is not sufficient nor sustainable,\" said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. \"You're punishing digital asset firms for allegedly not adhering to the law when they don't know it will apply to them.\"\n\nMcHenry said the SEC's approach was \"driving innovation overseas and endangering American competitiveness.\"\n\nGensler defended the agency's actions.\n\n\"We have a clear regulatory framework built up over 90 years,\" he said, adding that the exchanges \"are \"noncompliant generally, and they need to come into compliance.\"\n\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, reached a record of about $69,000 in November 2021, when the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate was near zero and investors were flooding into risk. The market changed in a hurry last year, as the Fed began steadily raising rates to fight inflation.\n\nIn early 2021, Palihapitiya predicted on CNBC that bitcoin would rise from $39,000 at the time to $100,000 and then up to $200,000.\n\n\"In what period, I don't know,\" he said. \"Five years, 10 years, but it's going there. And the reason is because every time you see all of this stuff happening, it just reminds you that, wow, our leaders are not as trustworthy and reliable as they used to be.\"\n\nLater in 2021, just before the peak, he said bitcoin had \"effectively replaced gold.\"\n\nBitcoin is currently trading at just over $27,300, down 60% from its all-time high."

As an industry first, this new service allows customers to buy and invest in bitcoin while avoiding the hassle and risks associated with using a cryptocurrency exchange. After placing an order on Ballet's website, customers will be sent a cold storage card loaded with the purchased bitcoin. The seamless retail experience can be compared to buying gold and silver coins from an online precious metals retailer, with the gold and silver shipped to the customer.\n\nLAS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / April 24, 2023 / The cryptocurrency wallet company Ballet announced today the launch of a new service, selling bitcoin for physical delivery. As an industry first, this new service allows customers to buy and invest in bitcoin while avoiding the hassle and risks associated with using a cryptocurrency exchange. After placing an order on Ballet's website, customers will be sent a cold storage card loaded with the purchased bitcoin. The seamless retail experience can be compared to buying gold and silver coins from an online precious metals retailer, with the gold and silver shipped to the customer.\n\nBallet Crypto Inc., Monday, April 24, 2023, Press release picture\n\n\"With our new service, we're offering a fundamentally new way to buy bitcoin that mimics the simplicity and convenience of buying gold and silver coins, while allowing customers to tap into the extraordinary investment potential of bitcoin,\" said Ballet founder and CEO Bobby Lee. \"We believe this service will make bitcoin accessible to hundreds of millions of new investors, and it will appeal to experienced users as well, as this is a great way to allow their friends and family members to easily buy and hold bitcoin,\" said Lee.\n\nThe purchased bitcoin will be delivered on Ballet's patented physical storage card, PURE Bitcoin, a variation of Ballet's flagship REAL Series cryptocurrency wallet. Similar to the REAL Series wallet, PURE Bitcoin is a stainless steel card that holds the bitcoin in cold storage, with the specific bitcoin denomination clearly shown on each card. This makes each loaded PURE Bitcoin card a physical bearer asset for bitcoin. There are no electronic components, providing superior durability and protection from cybersecurity threats such as hackers and malware. It's designed with tamper-evident security and anti-counterfeiting measures, and just like the REAL Series, it's incredibly easy to use. Once the customer receives their loaded PURE Bitcoin card, they can easily move the bitcoin on-chain to their wallet of choice. Alternatively, customers can choose to leave the bitcoin on the PURE Bitcoin cold storage card for long-term safekeeping. The bitcoins are held safely in cold storage on this physical card using Ballet's patented 2FKG implementation of the open-source BIP38 industry standard, which allows the user to generate the private keys to their digital bitcoins privately, at the time and location of their choosing.\n\nStory continues\n\nBy offering a retail experience similar to purchasing gold and silver coins, Ballet's new service aims to bridge the gap between traditional investment options and the surging demand for bitcoin. For the first time ever, customers can place an order on Ballet's website and then take physical delivery of their bitcoin securely, all without the need to use an online cryptocurrency exchange. By eliminating the need for an exchange, this service minimizes potential exposure to cybersecurity threats and reduces the learning curve for new Bitcoin users. Ballet is currently selling physical PURE Bitcoin cards in denominations of 0.1, 0.025, 0.01, and 0.005 BTC.\n\nThe innovative, user-friendly design of PURE Bitcoin cards makes them an ideal gift option for those looking to introduce friends and family to the world of bitcoin investing. They can also be advantageous for inheritance purposes, because unlike other cryptocurrency storage methods, heirs would not need technical expertise to access private keys or encrypted digital wallets.\n\nBallet is currently offering bitcoin for sale in the United States in states where regulations allow, with work ongoing to expand availability into more jurisdictions.\n\nBitcoin for physical delivery can be purchased at: https://bitcoin.ballet.com/\n\nAbout Ballet:\n\nBallet is a US-based cryptocurrency wallet company founded in 2019 by Bobby Lee, the former CEO of BTCC, one of the world's first and largest Bitcoin exchanges.
