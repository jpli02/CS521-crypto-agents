The global cryptocurrency market cap was trading higher around $1.1 trillion, rising 0.53% in the last 24 hours.\"Crypto markets have traded sideways in the last 24 hours. The crypto fear and greed index continues to maintain yesterday\u2019s position right in the middle of the scale with 50 points. BTC\u2019s hold around $26.5k remains firm despite events pertaining to the SEC lawsuits and the upcoming monetary policy decision by the Feds due next week,\" Parth Chaturvedi, Investments Lead at CoinSwitch Ventures, said.The total volume in DeFi stood at $1.91 billion, 7.38% of the total crypto market 24-hour volume.

Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is currently 46.69%, an increase of 0.10% over the day, according to CoinMarketCap.\"The SEC action on crypto firms has not impacted BTC prices in a big way as the world\u2019s largest crypto holds strong above the $26,000 mark. The largest altcoin, ETH, also remains resilient and did not slide further in the last 24 hours which is mainly due to optimism around Fed\u2019s monetary policy decision which is due next week.

        "title": "JPMorgan Expects Retail Demand for Bitcoin to Remain Strong as Reward Halving Approaches - Nasdaq",
        "content": "By Landon Manning\n\nIn anticipation of the next halving event for Bitcoin, researchers from JPMorgan have declared their belief that the underlying asset will remain strong.\n\nAn integral component of Bitcoin\u2019s long-term viability is the cap on the volume of coins that can be mined. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and there is a gradual taper from the early days of extremely easy mining to a tiny crawl by the very end of bitcoin mining\u2019s lifespan. The mechanism for this gradual taper takes the form of the \u201chalving\u201d event, when certain passed milestones in bitcoin mined will automatically cut all mining rewards in half. In other words, the same amount of equipment and electricity will create half as many assets as it had a day before. The next halving is about a year away.\n\nThis event has happened three times in Bitcoin\u2019s past, and according to research published in June by JPMorgan, the last two halvings led to a rally in bitcoin\u2019s price. The 2024 halving seems well on track to continue this trend, as the report claims that a halving \u201cwould mechanically double bitcoin production cost to around $40,000, creating a positive psychological effect.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, the increase in production cost would help raise the floor for bitcoin\u2019s valuation, and lead to an increase in demand for coins in circulation. Institutional investment has diminished somewhat, the report claims, but Ordinals and the BRC-20 protocol have been attracting lots of attention from retail investors. This endorsement of future performance is particularly interesting from JPMorgan, as the firm has historically displayed a skeptical attitude for Bitcoin.\n\nOne of the main effects the halving will have on the Bitcoin community is its radical impact on miners. With such a sheer drop in productivity, mining firms will surely struggle to maintain market viability for the sheer output of equipment and electricity. Instead, only the firms that are the most well configured to run efficiently will be able to weather the storm. When less efficient miners are pushed out of the pool, this will leave these miners able to take home a bigger proportion of the pie. In the end, the halving will be a mechanism that forces the whole industry\u2019s hardware to optimize.\n\nIndeed, to an untrained observer, it might be quite surprising that the community is full of predictions that the halving will only spell good things for Bitcoin. How could increased costs of production be good for business? The simple answer is that, because Bitcoin has already been halved many times before and \u201ctrimming the fat\u201d of mining operations has historically led to more buzz from investment, Bitcoiners are assuming the same will take place again. The difficulty in acquiring fresh bitcoin will lead to increased interest in purchasing old ones, and the mining industry will be disrupted in a way that ultimately benefits it.\n\nThe halving is expected to take place in about a year, according to current industry estimates, and there is still plenty of time to observe the trends in the market and adjust these predictions accordingly. With years of experience behind it, however, the Bitcoin community is resolute.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."
