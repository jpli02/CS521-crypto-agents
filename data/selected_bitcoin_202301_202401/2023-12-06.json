        "content": "JPMorgan Chase CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon gestures as he speaks during the U.S. Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee oversight hearing on Wall Street firms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 6, 2023.\n\n\"If I was the government, I'd close it down,\" he added.\n\n\"I've always been deeply opposed to crypto, bitcoin, etc.,\" the head of the largest U.S. bank by assets said under questioning from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \"The only true use case for it is criminals, drug traffickers \u2026 money laundering, tax avoidance.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon lashed out at bitcoin and its peers, suggesting in remarks Wednesday on Capitol Hill that cryptocurrencies should be banned.\n\nThe remarks are the latest broadside from Dimon against cryptocurrencies, though his bank is heavily involved in blockchain, the enabling technology for the $1.6 trillion industry.\n\nIn previous statements, Dimon has called bitcoin \"a hyped-up fraud,\" a comment he later walked back. He had also likened it to a \"pet rock.\"\n\nUnder further questioning from Warren, Dimon and several other CEOs of large banks brought before the committee as part of a routine hearing on the industry, agreed that crypto companies should face the same anti-money-laundering regulations as the major financial institutions.\n\nThe topic marked a rare note of unity between the banking leaders and Warren, usually a harsh critic of the industry.\n\n\"When it comes to banking policy, I am not usually holding hands with the CEOs of multibillion-dollar banks, but this is a matter of national security. Terrorists, drug traffickers and rogue nations should be barred from using crypto for their dangerous activities. It is time for Congress to act,\" Warren said.\n\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:"

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day\n\nWhat we're watching\n\nWhat we're reading\n\nEconomic data releases and earnings\n\nYou may have heard: Bitcoin is back. The price of the biggest cryptocurrency has surged past $42,000 and is up more than 150% this year.\n\nWith the price recovery, we\u2019ve seen the reemergence of a certain kind of financial media character: the shill, the opportunist, the tout, the pumper.\n\nThey were everywhere when bitcoin was climbing to record highs in 2021. When Americans were getting government checks, sitting at home, and looking to strike it rich, crypto seemed like a no-brainer, driven in no small part by FOMO \u2014 and these hype men saying it was the future of finance.\n\nThe voices got quieter when the price crashed from above $60,000 to below $20,000, although the faithful insisted this was part of bitcoin\u2019s \u201ctypical cycle.\u201d That quiet turned to embarrassment for some with the collapse of the Terra stablecoin, the implosion of FTX (with whom many had financial relationships), and the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried.\n\nBut another characteristic of some of this cohort is their lack of shame. So even as all of those events were unfolding, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find them on Twitter, hewing fast to their stated belief that bitcoin was the answer \u2014 to getting rich, to finance, to whatever.\n\nWill retail investors get caught up in FOMO once again? Signs point to yes. The first leg of the latest rally seems to have been driven in part by predictions (once again) for institutional investment in crypto, tied in part to the anticipation of SEC approval for spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nWith price action comes renewed retail interest. Robinhood just reported that November crypto trading volumes surged by 75% compared to October. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi that price appreciation begets media interest begets retail investment:\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cYou are starting to see retail investors wake up to certain segments of the rally. What tends to happen is, we've seen in the past as the price of bitcoin approaches all-time highs, the media coverage and intensity increases. And I think that plays a role as well. If people are just hearing more about crypto around them, they tend to become more interested, and you start to see that reflected in trading activity, at least in the past.\u201d\n\nAll of this is not to say that bitcoin won\u2019t keep going up, or that it couldn't indeed play some role in the future of finance. But I\u2019ve been at this long enough to be suspicious when a bet on an asset starts to sound like a religious belief \u2014 especially when the belief is intertwined with profit and depends on you also shelling out cash.\n\nThere are rational voices in the crypto universe who don\u2019t seem to just be relying on the greater fool theory. One of them is Devin Ryan, who covers the fintech industry for Citizens JMP Securities. He\u2019s looking at the sheer scale of the ETF industry, and the giant asset managers like BlackRock who are sure to allocate to their Bitcoin ETF if it is indeed approved.\n\n\u201cPeople are getting a bit ahead of the ETFs,\u201d Ryan told Yahoo Finance Live. But just \"a very small fraction\" of asset managers' trillions would in fact be enormous. Just think of all the private clients allocating a few million here, a few there.\n\n\"That could be hundreds of billions of market cap expansion,\" Ryan said.\n\nIt may not be the moon, but it's something.\n\nmorning brief image\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance"
