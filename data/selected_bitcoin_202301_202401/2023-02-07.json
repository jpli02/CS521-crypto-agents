        "content": "More than $1.3 trillion was wiped off the cryptocurrency market in 2022 as the fallout from the FTX collapse weighed on investor confidence.\n\nBitcoin rose above $23,000 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell addressed an economics forum in Washington, D.C., saying that inflation is coming down.\n\nBitcoin added 1% to $23,236.80, according to Coin Metrics. Ether rose 1.3% to $1,667.63. Bitcoin struggled to hold the $23,000 level on Monday after dipping below that mark over the weekend.\n\nPowell said in a question-and-answer session at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. that although the process of getting inflation down has started, it \"has a long way to go\" and that these are \"the very early stages.\"\n\n\"We expect 2023 to be a year of significant declines in inflation. It's actually our job to make sure that that's the case,\" he said. \"My guess is it will take certainly into not just this year, but next year to get down close to 2%.\"\n\nCrypto prices briefly turned lower alongside the stock market, after Powell said future economic reports may force the central bank to keep hiking rates aggressively.\n\nTreasury yields declined during the speech \u2013 the 10-year note yield fell 1 basis point and the 2-year lost 5 basis points. The U.S. dollar index also dipped. Yields and the dollar index tend to move inversely to crypto.\n\nAfter climbing about 40% to start the year, bitcoin has hit a speed bump in the past week as investors who have doubted the staying power of the rally prepared for further macro-driven volatility in crypto prices this year."

        "title": "DCG sells shares in Grayscale crypto trusts in push to raise funds - Financial Times",
        "content": "Print this page\n\nCrypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group has begun to sell shares in several of its most prized cryptocurrency funds at a steep discount, as it seeks to raise capital to pay back creditors of its bankrupt lending arm.\n\nSoftBank-backed DCG has started to offload its holdings in several investment vehicles run by its subsidiary Grayscale, according to US securities filings seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe move to sell down the assets underscores the financial difficulties at DCG as it tries to raise funds to support collapsed lending units under crypto broker Genesis, while seeking to preserve its most cash-generative business.\n\nConnecticut-based DCG, founded in 2015 by former banker Barry Silbert, is one of the largest and oldest investors in crypto coins and businesses. It is backed by investors including SoftBank, Singapore\u2019s sovereign wealth fund GIC and Alphabet\u2019s venture arm CapitalG.\n\nGrayscale, DCG\u2019s asset management business, is an important asset: it earns hundreds of millions of dollars per year in lucrative fees for managing large pools of bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies in funds that investors can buy shares in from their brokerage accounts.\n\nDCG is selling stakes in one of Grayscale\u2019s largest trusts even though the shares over the past two years have fallen to substantial discounts to the underlying value of cryptocurrency they hold.\n\nIt is seeking to raise money after the lending units of Genesis, its crypto broker, collapsed into bankruptcy in January, becoming the latest large crypto company to fail after the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX exchange rocked the digital asset industry.\n\nThe US group has been attempting to repay more than $3bn to its creditors and has been embroiled in a public dispute with the Winklevoss twins\u2019s Gemini exchange over the debts. To raise further funds, the group last month hired Lazard bankers to help sell its trade news site CoinDesk. It is also seeking to offload some of its $500mn venture portfolio, the Financial Times previously reported.\n\nOn Monday, after months of negotiations, DCG reached an agreement with Genesis\u2019 main creditors, including Gemini. \u201cThis plan is a critical step forward towards a substantial recovery of assets,\u201d said Cameron Winklevoss.\n\nDCG\u2019s recent share sales have focused on Grayscale\u2019s ethereum fund, where the group has moved to sell about a quarter of its stock to raise as much as $22mn in several trades since January 24, according to the filings. The company is selling at about $8 per share, despite each share\u2019s claim to $16 of ether.\n\n\u201cThis is simply part of our ongoing portfolio rebalancing,\u201d DCG said.\n\nGrayscale earns a 2.5 per cent management fee on the 3mn of ether in the trust, equating to $209mn in the year to end September. DCG last sold shares in the Ethereum Trust in 2021, when the vehicle traded nearly at par with its net asset value, according to the filings provided by The Washington Service. Today the shares trade at half the value of the ethereum coin they represent.\n\nIts flagship bitcoin trust holds about 3 per cent of all bitcoin, worth $14.7bn, from which Grayscale earns a 2 per cent fee. It earned $303mn from fees on the bitcoin trust in the first nine months of 2022, according to securities filings.\n\nDCG has also moved to sell down smaller blocks of shares in Grayscale\u2019s Litecoin Trust, Bitcoin Cash Trust, Ethereum Classic Trust and Digital Large Cap Fund, according to the filings.\n\nThe group does not allow investors to redeem their shares for the coins held in the trusts, which would help close the significant net asset value gaps. Grayscale is suing the US Securities and Exchange Commission over blocking the creation of a spot bitcoin ETF, arguing that this would benefit investors and allow redemptions.\n\n\u201cDCG faces a trade-off: they could allow redemptions and enable liquidity at par value, including for their own holdings, but they\u2019re better off not doing it because they make so much money from the management fees,\u201d said Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of Lumida Wealth. \u201cClosing the discount would mean giving up this cash cow.\u201d\n\nBefore cryptocurrency was easily tradable through reputable exchanges, the shares in Grayscale\u2019s trusts traded at a large premium to the value of the coins they held, incentivising holders of bitcoin and ethereum to hand over their coins for shares in the Grayscale vehicles."

        "title": "Looking for Exposure to Bitcoin? These 2 Small Bitcoin Mining Stocks Are a 'Must-Own,' According to One Analyst - Yahoo Finance",
        "content": "The end goal of investing is profit, and few investments have shown the long-term profit of bitcoin. Yes, the true story in cryptocurrency is its extreme volatility, but the underlying fact is simple: investors who bought into bitcoin five years ago, and held on, have tripled their money. Even this past January, BTC surged 40%.\n\nBut buying bitcoin isn\u2019t the only way to cash in on it, there are also the bitcoin mining stocks. These are firms, generally small, that own large-scale server rigs capable of computing the blockchain links \u2013 and creating new bitcoins. In fact, according to H.C. Wainwright analyst Mike Colonnese, \"the median return for publicly traded BTC miners was 124% in January, more than 3x the performance of BTC.\"\n\nElaborating further on the opportunity, Colonnese writes: \u201cWe expect improved mining economics, driven by higher BTC prices and moderating energy costs (partially offset by rising network difficulty) to drive upward estimate revisions for the group throughout 2023 and see continued multiple expansion for mining stocks. As such, it is plausible the miners could continue outperforming BTC, in our view...\u201d\n\nOf course, Colonnese doesn\u2019t deny the risks inherent in this path \u2013 he notes that bitcoin mining stocks will be sensitive to negative macro-data \u2013 but he makes a compelling case that the positives justify the risks.\n\nKeeping that in mind, we\u2019ve opened up the TipRanks database and pulled the details on two small bitcoin mining stocks that Colonnese sees as potential winners in 2023. For investors interested in betting on the blockchain, these should present some interesting paths forward.\n\nCipher Mining Inc. (CIFR)\n\nThe first company we\u2019ll look at is Cipher Mining, a US-based bitcoin miner that is still in the early stages of its ramp-up. The company has three active mining sites, and is working both to expand its existing exahash capacity and to develop new mining sites. The company is currently generating bitcoin at a rate of approximately 1.4 EH/s.\n\nStory continues\n\nCipher\u2019s chief mining facility, Odessa, operates on up to 207 megawatts of power, and its mining operations came online this past November. Odessa is supplemented by two additional sites, Alborz, a 40 megawatt, wind-powered mining facility, and Bear and Chief, a site which was completed in October of last year and can operate at up to 20 megawatts.\n\nAll three of these sites are boosting their bitcoin production capabilities. Per Cipher\u2019s 3Q22 report, the last released, the company generated 196 bitcoin in that quarter. The fourth quarter report won\u2019t be out until March, but we do have the December and January monthly production updates available.\n\nIn December, Cipher mined 225 bitcoin, and in January, the company mined another 343. In each of those months, the company\u2019s bitcoin generation exceeded all of 3Q22 by a wide margin, and its generation rate is accelerating. As of the end of January, Cipher listed 424 bitcoin held as assets, 41,000 mining rigs deployed in its data centers, and a 4.3 exahash-per-second operating rate.\n\nCasting his eye on this bitcoin miner, H.C. Wainwright's Colonnese writes: \u201cWe are upgrading shares of CIFR to Buy from Neutral on strong execution, best-in-class mining economics, and improved sentiment for BTC\u2026 Cipher now has the sixth-largest hashing capacity of all publicly traded BTC miners in North America, and we estimate the company is capable of producing ~14.5 BTC per day. This equates to over $330,000 in daily mining revenues when applying current BTC prices of $23,000, a substantial increase over the ~$50,000 in daily revenues the company generated in October 2022. We applaud management\u2019s ability to rapidly scale the company\u2019s mining operations over the span of just a few months\u2026\u201d\n\nAlong with his new Buy rating on the stock, Colonnese includes a price target of $3, suggesting a 12-month upside potential of 76%. (To watch Colonnese\u2019s track record, click here)\n\nThis is the only analyst review on file for Cipher, which is currently trading for $1.70. (See CIFR stock forecast)\n\nHive Blockchain Technologies (HIVE)\n\nNext up is Hive Blockchain, a Vancouver, Canada-based company with bitcoin mining operations in its home country as well as in Sweden and Iceland. Hive Blockchain boasts that it operates its mining facilities, which take up to 50 megawatts of power, on 100% renewable energy sources.\n\nThose mining operations are extensive. As of the end of January this year, Hive Blockchain was operating at an exahash rate of 2.68 EH/s. The company has been deploying new mining server rigs in large numbers over recent months, significantly boosting its capacity.\n\nIndeed, the December and January monthly updates show that Hive\u2019s capacity has been growing. The company mined 213.8 bitcoin in December, and another 260 in January. Month-over-month, the company\u2019s mining operations generated a 22% increase in bitcoin.\n\nHive has committed to a policy of \u2018hold on for dear life,\u2019 or HODL; that is, keeping a large reserve of bitcoin to hold for the long-term. Under its HODL policy, Hive had holdings totaling 2,430 bitcoin at the end of January, worth over $56 million in US currency at current prices.\n\nH.C. Wainwright's Colonnese is impressed with Hive's execution, writing: \u201cHive consistently ranks in the top 3 publicly traded BTC miners when it comes to efficiency as measured by BTC mined relative to the company\u2019s active hash rate, which we attribute to above average uptime from both stable electricity sources and optimized proprietary software. In 2022, Hive produced 20% more BTC per EH of capacity than its peers, a significant competitive advantage, in our view, and a demonstration of Hive\u2019s operational prowess.\"\n\n\"While the stock has rallied [150%] YTD, alongside the rebound in BTC prices, we see additional share price appreciation driven by hash rate expansion and efficiency gains, as well as improved sentiment for BTC throughout 2023,\u201d the analyst summed up.\n\nIn-line with this stance, Colonnese rates the stock as a Buy, with a $5 price target to indicate its potential for ~39% share appreciation this year.\n\nThis small-cap bitcoin miner has slipped under the radar a bit, and only has 2 recent analyst reviews. They both agree, however, that it\u2019s a stock to buy, making the Moderate Buy analyst consensus unanimous. The shares are selling for $3.60 and their $6 average target indicates room for ~67% upside over the next 12 months.
